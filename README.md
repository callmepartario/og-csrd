https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd

This document is a hypertext version of the April 18, 2023 edition of the [Cypher System Reference Document (CSRD)](http://csol.montecookgames.com/). It is intended to help Game Masters (GMs), players, and others interested in the Cypher System to learn more about it, create characters, worlds, and share stories together.

## OG-CSRD Goals

In compiling Old Gus' Cypher System Reference Document (OG-CSRD) from the source material, I had the following goals:

### Ease of Use

The document should be one single, self-enclosed page. The document should organize CSRD material as efficiently and consistently as possible, with "quick reference" navigation providing navigation to the most frequently used parts of the document. The document should be equally readable on a mobile phone, desktop, or screen-reader.

### Alignment with the Cypher System Rulebook

The document should generally align the CSRD content to the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/). Players and GMs should have little trouble "getting on the same page" even if they are reading from the two different sources.

### Genre and Editorial Spirit

Care should be taken when incorporating content, streamlining a a single-stream reading order, unifying presentation and strengthening interplay between genres. Let the "chest of toys" metaphor in the Chapter 2 of the Cypher System Rulebook be a guiding light—and also let us organize the toy chest as fastidiously as possible. Printed errors in the CSRD should be corrected, and vestigial text omitted. Any significant alterations should include a rationale for those changes.

### Embrace Community and Designer Wisdom

Editor's notes should draw upon the experiences of people who have spent years running and teaching the Cypher System (like the fine folks of the [Cypher Unlimited Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/WQYRWhn). Valuable blog posts from [Monte Cook Games' "Game Better" series](https://www.montecookgames.com/category/all-news/game-better/) should be linked where applicable.

Readers are encouraged to support the creators. Consider buying products listed in the [Additional Descriptors](https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/#additional-descriptors) or [Additional Foci](https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/#additional-foci) sections to ensure the longevity of our collective imaginations.
## Future Plans

This is a living document, and corrections will need to be made in the future. If ever Monte Cook Games expands the CSRD further, that new content should be incorporated that content into this document accordingly.
