## Old Gus' Reference Document (OG-CSRD)

https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd

This online reference for the Cypher System Reference Document (CSRD) provides an in-depth look at the game with content aligned to the [Cypher System Rulebook (2019)](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/).

Readers are encouraged to support Monte Cook Games, who have so generously made this information available. Consider buying products listed in [What's In The Book?](https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/#choose-products) to ensure ongoing support and developmnt for the CSRD's informing material.

## Old Gus' Unofficial Cypher System Player's Guide (OG-CSPG)

https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/og-cspg.html

This should go without saying, but Old Gus' Unofficial Cypher System Player's Guide (OG-CSPG) does not contain the official Cypher System rules. These rules have been rearranged, rewritten, and condensed so that you can learn to play game quickly and easily. It also guides you through creating and customizing your player character (PC) before the game, or as you continue playing with the GM.
