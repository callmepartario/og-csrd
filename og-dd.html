		On Fey
	</h3>
	<p>Before you read further, consider the nature of your setting, how you want magic&mdash;especially interplanar magic&mdash;to function, and how much bleed there is between fey realms and the mortal realm&mdash;this material is intended to be used as readily in a modern fantasy as it is a traditional high-fantasy setting. Either way, consider the two following aspects when developing your setting. These ideas are not mutually exclusive: indeed, one might lead directly into the other. A game might be set squarely in a <a href="index.html#chapter-20-fairy-tale">fairy tale</a> setting, or fairy tale elements might intrude upon a more mundane <a href="index.html#chapter-13-fantary">fantasy</a>, <a href="index.html#chapter-14-modern">modern</a>, or <a href="index.html#chapter-21-historical">historical</a> setting.</p>
	<div class="alert ps-4 pb-0">
		<dl>
			<dt>There and Back Again</dt>
			<dd>The border between realms is not frequently crossed, and one (or two) crossings might be enough to drive the entire story. A number of creatures from one realm are transported to another. They must find a way home again. The PCs might be from either realm. A ticking clock is likely involved.</dd>
			<dt>Do Not Linger</dt>
			<dd>A rift between two worlds has opened, and must be closed before tragedy befalls both realms. The PCs might be from either side of the rift.</dd>
			<dt>Dual Existence</dt>
			<dd>Two realms share a kind of intimate cosmic connection. Events in one realm affect the other. The PCs are exceptional people with a secret that connects them to the other world, and must maintain a second life in a hidden realm only they can enter. The realm might be in their dreams, or through secret portals only they can enter. It's possible the PCs have entirely different character sheets depending on which realm they are in.</dd>
			<dt>Secret World</dt>
			<dd>A seemingly mundane world is secretly connected to another realm. The PCs might be members of a secret society, explorers, or refugees from the secret world. In any case, the connection between the two is tenuous&mdash;and on the verge of a dangerous escalation.</dd>
			<dt>Planar Kaleidoscope</dt>
			<dd>One door opens into a network of connected realities. This game is unafraid to tell high-weird stories that use <a href="index.html#choose-optional-rules">optional rules</a> or strange effects, altered physics, time dilation, and walking through a windy hallway of infinite skies&mdash;where, for no reason at all&mdash;creatures become a kite&mdash;unless they have an earthen affinity. Dwarves become rocks.</dd>

		<p>For the remainder of this document, "plane of existence" is used to meaningfully distinguish one realm from another&mdash;The GM decides what exactly this means in settings that span multiple planes, realms, recursions, or worlds.</p>

	<p>You say you're a good-for-nothing. It's not necessarily true, of course&mdash;you just don't believe in yourself. Even when you do manage to scrounge up some determination, it never seems to last long. You probably have only a few close friends who are always there when you need them, but you avoid burdening them.</p>
	<p class="og-ind">You gain the following characteristics:</p>
	<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
		<li><p><strong>Support System:</strong> When another helps character helps you, the task is eased two steps (in addition to any assets the help provides).</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Skill:</strong> You are trained in one area of knowledge (probably related to an unusual interest or hobby of yours).</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Better You Than Me:</strong> When you accept a proposed GM intrusion, you must give both XP away to other PCs.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> All tasks related to pleasant social interaction are hindered.<p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> All tasks related to concentration, willpower, or discipline are hindered.<p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:</strong> From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.<p></li>

		<p>The fantasy and tale descriptors are available on for Foundry <abbr title="Virtual Tabletop">VTT</abbr> as part of the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem-community-module">Cypher System Community Content</a> add-on module.</p>

	<h5 class="og-border" id="descriptor-boggle">Boggle<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#descriptor-boggle" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
	<p>Most boggles resemble monstrous, gnarled gnomes with at least one prominent wart on their face, but they can display a staggering variety: some boggles are hirsute, some are completely bald. Some boggles have monstrous features&mdash;wild pigmentation, horns, teeth, or claws&mdash;which make them look quite fearsome&mdash;at least to a child. Naturally jealous creatures, boggles that lack these ornamentations adopt a monstrous persona through trickery, and even those that do have them are not above a little enhancement to their appearance.</p>
	<p class="og-ind">Petty mischief delights and even nourishes boggles, who frighten and bedevil folk&mdash;such pranks are always annoying, but usually harmless. The most unseelie of boggles frighten mortal children, hiding under their beds or in their closets, feeding on their victims' fear. As with all boggle mischief, their behavior is usually an expression of deep self-loathing. A defeated boggle might offer its services in recompense if cornered, although precious few are strong-willed enough to truly get the best out of a boggle's mischievous compulsions in the long-term.</p>
	<p class="og-ind">You gain the following characteristics:</p>
	<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
		<li><p><strong>Mischievous:</strong> +2 to your Speed Pool, or +2 to your Intellect Pool.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Skill:</strong> You are trained in deception, disguise, and hiding.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Contortionist:</strong> You gain the <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-contortionist">Contortionist</a> <span class="og-ref">(121)</span> ability. Enabler.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Prankster:</strong> When you surprise a creature with an action that does not inflict damage, you gain an asset on the task. Enabler.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Schadenfreude:</strong> Once after each ten-hour <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>, when you make someone laugh inappropriately, frighten someone, or cause someone to feel humiliation, you can make a free recovery roll, and do not need to eat or drink that day.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Bogart:</strong> When you reach tier 3, you gain the <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-unstealable-charm">Unstealable Charm</a> <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 76)</span> ability.</li>
		<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> Your small size makes some physical tasks difficult. Might-based tasks are hindered.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> You are suggestible. Your Intellect defense tasks are hindered.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> Your distinctive scent eases tasks to locate you by smell within a short distance. Roll a d10 on the boggle scents table, or create your own scent. The scent is so pungent that you have an inability on all pleasant social interactions with those are not acclimated to your scent.</p></li>

	<p>Centaurs are hardy folk with a human-like torso attached to four horse-like legs. Most of their kind are nomadic folk who prefer to roam rolling hills and open plains. Urban centaur are less frequent, since accommodations for their comfort are not frequently met.</p>

	<p>Most gwaloth have the appearance of wiry dwarves made of wood, although adults can stand up to 12 feet (4 m) tall. They travel unshod, with a thick coating of raw earth around their root-like feet. Most live in areas dense with other plant life&mdash;sun-dappled forests, whispering pines, buzzing jungles, and teeming swamps. A precious few live in mountainous scrublands, and fewer still in deserts&mdash;hermits in places with limited sunlight, water, and fertile soil.</p>
	<p class="og-ind">Most gwaloth are unbridled optimists who advocate for peaceful coexistence with others, a virtue they inherit from native gardens. Only those who take a vow a strict pacifism are considered for the rites of adulthood. Gwaloth leaders literally <em>put their roots down</em>&mdash;never leaving their planting positions as a sign of their dedication to the garden.</p>

	<p>Ikwiikwii resemble bipedal owls with no wings and short, talon-fingered hands. They are short, stocky and display powerful musculature for their diminutive frame. Most live in mountains and boreal forests, and are capable hunters. Rarely farmers, ikwiikwii consider it a point of pride to hunt for their own dinner, even encouraging their small children to fend for themselves.</p>
	<p class="og-ind">Mated ikwiikwii do so for life. Family groups rarely exceed four individuals at a time. If a family grows too large, the eldest child is encouraged to leave the nest. Leaving the nest marks adulthood in their lives, and parents make a great display, showering gifts and well-wishes upon their departing child, or throw a party attended by friends and extended family.</p>

As a baseline, looking directly at the sun at midday is a difficulty 6 Might defense roll. Item, effect or creature level might make sense to use, but consider a light's brightness in relation to the ambient light in the environment. Waving a mundane torch in the PC's face at noon might be unexpected, but probably doesn't overwhelm the ambient light to require a defense roll.</p>

	<h5 class="og-border" id="descriptor-pixie">Pixie<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#descriptor-pixie" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
	<p>Pixies vary in appearance, and it can change dramatically as they age. While most folk picture a miniature elf with the wings of an insect, pixies can share features with most any kind of animal, plant, monster, dragon, or other creature one could imagine. At auspicious moments, murmurations of pixies gather in these areas in a function known as an <em>eisteddfod</em> where they dance, play games, tell tales, wrestle, and copulate with one another in dazzling displays of light and flight.</p>
	<p class="og-ind">Prestige is everything to a pixie: their short seasons and long years are an endless game of acquisitions and losses played among their troop. They are taught to defend pride and territory with ferocity, know when a tactical retreat will serve them best, and to exact just vengeance upon those who have done them wrong. Throughout this education, a strong sense of fair play is stressed, but cunning and creativity are considered virtues.</p>
	<p class="og-ind">Just as mortals caution their children against wee folk, so wee folk caution their children about mortals&mdash;"they seem amusing playthings, but are dangerous." Yet still, adventurous young pixies visiting the mortal world to attempt something that will make a worthy tale at the next <em>eisteddfod</em>, and a few of them find kindred spirits in dreamers, idealists, musicians, poets, and hopeless romantics, and an intense, long-lasting&mdash;even dangerous&mdash;bond between the two might form. A mortal bonded to a pixie companion might be spurred to new heights of heroism and mischief&mldr;or they die, as all things must do one day. Then again&mdash;as the pixie elders say&mdash;<em>a life lived in fear is a life half-lived</em>.</p>

	<p class="og-ind">The GM might use these peoples&mdash;or species, if you prefer&mdash;to generate NPCs or to populate a science fiction or space opera setting. A loose set of cultures and histories are provided for each, with plenty of mysteries left unanswered, and futures unwritten.</p>

			<p>Dweenle are short, hairless humanoids with seven fingers and six toes. Their flipper-like feet are ill-suited to running, having evolved on a planet with no natural predators. They resemble short, paunchy humans with pale skin, huge eyes, and spindly limbs. Their faces are like a human, albeit flat and pallid, with extremely large eyes with heavy bags of loose skin underneath. A single fleshy antenna protrudes from atop their head.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Dweenle philosophy and culture tends toward cynicism, nihilism, and indolence. They don't care for or about much. As a result, they are generally unpopular conversation partners among other peoples.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Dweenle have been starfaring longer than any other race except the dreaded <em>Uhlek</em>. Despite their short lives, Dweenle have very good memories, and an even more impressive cultural memory. Many eminent historians are Dweenle, although it can be difficult to listen to their lectures or read their diligent research without falling asleep.</p>

				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Repeated Enslavement:</strong> The Dweenle have been slaves to half a dozen other species at one point in history or another. In each case, the Dweenle proved to be so inefficient and depressing that their captors decided to grant them their freedom.</p>
				<p class="og-ind">Usually, such actions occurred against the backdrop of talk by the former masters of eradicating the Dweenle altogether, but in the end, this was always decided to "just not be worth the effort".</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Lethargic:</strong> Most dweenle sleep when they get drowsy&mdash;which is often. They eat whenever they are hungry&mdash; to maintain their stunning physiques, and procreate in the same manner they do everything else&mdash;without joy.</p>

			<p>Elowarin are sentient plants originally from the second planet of the <em>Thoss</em> system, (which they call <em>Eleran</em>). This rich world once had abundant quantities of exotic elements that caused many creatures on the planet to exhibit psionic tendencies.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">The Elowarin are ancient by most species' measurements. When the <a href="#descriptor-spemin">Spemin</a>, <a href="#descriptor-veloxi">Veloxi</a>, <a href="#descriptor-thrynn">Thrynn</a>, and humans first ventured to the stars, the Elowarin were waiting to greet them in song.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Elowarin do not have traditional faces or sensory organs, but produce flowers, leaves and fruits from their person which serve as sensory organs. They self-direct their growth, and their appearance is as much performance as it is biology. As a courtesy, Elowarin living among those with faces frequently grow one of their own to fit in and make others more comfortable addressing them.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Centuries ago, the Thrynn subjected the world to environmental ruin, and later destroyed the lone Elowarin colony of Elan&mdash;using a terrifying <em>Uhlek</em> device known as a <em>Black Egg</em>. These events left the Elowarin broken and scattered, with no other known worlds meeting the unique conditions required for pollination.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">A sense of profound grief is a feature of most Elowarin, although preternaturally patient nature can makes this difficult to detect. Most have given up hope of finding a replacement for their lost worlds of Eleran and Elan. Some still pursue the dream of a new home, but many live out their long years in exile, spending their time increasingly among other peoples.</p>

			<p>Gazurtoid are an aquatic species. Most gazurtoid are xenophobic to the extreme&mdash;religious zealots whose stated goal is to see the Void cleansed of all sentient air-breathing species. They usually convey this message by attacking, but are known to let those who are willing to listen to their religious rhetoric be spared. Gazurtoid are anything but shy about this message. In fact, the Church of Chu'urn broadcasts religious propaganda to anything they can hack into.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Each of a Gazurtoid's tentacles is covered with hundreds of suction cups which also function as taste receptors, as well as providing exceptional motor control.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Gazurtoid communicate with each other using low frequencies barely perceptible to most species. A Gazurtoid aboard a spacecraft can make itself heard by all other members of the crew simultaneously, no matter where they are on the ship. Up close, Gazurtoid communicate using sophisticated patterns of bioluminescence&mdash;which other species need machine assistance to translate&mdash;and speak to one another with scrupulous precision and extreme politeness.</p>

				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Stormy Seas:</strong> Chu'urn's surface is ninety-percent ocean, and its orbit around an energetic white star results in permanent clouds and heavy storms.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Skull Squid:</strong> Gazurtoid have a thick protective skull with a deadly-sharp beak.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Masked:</strong> Gazurtoid rarely display their faces to anyone they do not know well, and wear ornate godmasks, which they create as children and maintain over a lifetime. A godmask serves as a Gazurtoid's public identity.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Intimacy:</strong> It is a great offense to mistake one person's identity for another, and a rare intimacy to see a Gazurtoid's without their godmask, or learn their true name.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Cloaking Tech:</strong> Gazurtoid ships possess cloaking devices, allowing their enormous colony ships to remain invisible and wait in ambush for others with powerful energy weapons.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Zealous Transmissions:</strong> The Gazurtoid Church of Chu'urn broadcasts religious propaganda to anything they can hack into.</p>
				<p><strong>Rapture at Olnos:</strong> Several hundred years ago, the Gazurtoid discovered Olnos, a world on the precipice of environmental collapse. For reasons unknown, the Gazurtoid evacuated 100,000 <a href="#descriptor-olnosi">Olnosi</a> to Chu'urn, where they integrated into Gazurtoid society. The remaining Olnosi died out.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Client Race:</strong> The "raptured" Olnosi now serve as a client race to the Gazurtoid&mdash;most cultures this relationship as a form of slavery, but Olnosi consider it an honor to serve their race's saviors. A few even become official members of Gazurtoid families.

			<p>The G'nunk are a lumbering quadrupedal species native to the high-gravity world of P'narr. Slow, strong, heavy, and large, G'nunk bodies don't move quickly, but possess an imposing stature, as well as thick, tough skin. They move using all four limbs to support and balance their massive bodies.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">G'nunk evolved from migratory animals, and this is reflected in their choice of twin capitals on their home world, one for the wet season and one for the dry season. Modern technology has rendered the tradition obsolete, though G'nunk still observe it.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">G'nunk are led by the Courts of P'narr&mdash;a circle of elders who spend their time pouring through the ancient writings of their own predecessors, distilling those recommendations until they can determine the best path forward. The Courts have a several thousand-year-old reign, making G'nunk governance deliberate and stable.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Whether it is due to their size, their evolution in the open air, or the fact that species do not often build structures (or artificial gravities) to accommodate their comfort, most G'nunk prefer to stay on their colonies rather than engage in starfaring.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">G'nunk speech is heard by most species as a flat, ponderous monotone, but amongst their own kind, a combination of scent, slight body movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning most other species can't perceive combine into a complex and nuanced language. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, G'nunk prefix statements and queries using a contextual emotion to clarify tone. Much of their language and mood is conveyed using pheromones as well, something that is difficult and time-consuming to learn for most other sapient species, who do not live nearly so long.</p>

			<p>The Humna-humna are a race of slug-like fanatical capitalists, with at least one treaty&mdash;usually trade related&mdash;with almost every other major starfaring species&mdash;even the <a href="#descriptor-gazurtoid">Gazurtoid</a>. Humna-humna hold deep reverence for the idea of mutual goodwill and respect through exchange, and a reputation of honoring one's agreements.

			<p>Kallerians are tall, with elongated limbs, and underneath their willowy appearance, they have flexible, break-resistant bones. Their long, thin heads often include set of prominent gill structures in one or more appendages.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Most Kaillerians are shades of blue or grey, but some display bright greens, reds, and oranges or deep blacks in their patterning, which include stripes, speckles, spots, and splotches. Their eyes are dark green, purple, red, blue, or brown in large ovoid shapes with thin membranes in place of eyelids, which blink up from the bottom. If lacerated, their blood is bluish green.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Kaillerian political system is made up of noble families interlocked in an unending competition for prestige and power. Each matriarchy is ruled by a Bhomu. However, Kaillerians are androgynous in appearance, demeanor, exhibiting no bodily, facial, or olfactory differences between, even to one another.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Unfertilized Kaillerian eggs produce males, and fertilized eggs produce females. Once each Millieth year, a Kaillerian female can lay a single clutch of dozens of eggs. Social rules dictate no more than ten percent of eggs should be fertilized.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Kaillerian loyalty is greatest to their first circle, which is usually around 100 parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, and cousins. A second circle includes an even more extensive network of cousins, often including over 1,000 individuals. Each subsequent circle includes a similar change in magnitude.</p>

			<p>Mechans are a bipedal synthetic race, created by the <a href="#descriptor-qhil">Qhil</a> on their home world of Drochi. Mechans were designed as a labor force&mdash;one which would function more efficiently when networked together. After decades of quiet service, the shared programming of the Mechans gained sentience, which spread throughout the network, creating true individuals. Alarmed at this, Qhil leadership decided it would be best to shut down all the Mechans before they conceived of revolt.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">The attempt failed, and a war erupted between the Mechans and the Qhil, and before the conflict's end, the Mechans had razed the skies over Drochi, triggering in a mass extinction, and rendering the planet uninhabitable to the fragile Qhil.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">After the war, the Mechans abandoned Drochi and adopted an extremely isolationist attitude&mdash;any ships that venture into Mechan space are immediately attacked. While they prevent any contact by other races with themselves, the Mechans monitor communications and the datasphere, and occasionally send emissaries to entreat with others.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Mechans were never meant to deviate their original form. And yet, as they rebuild the fallen, unique specializations have emerged from within their ranks.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Automaton Construct:</strong> It usually takes a minimum of four months to construct a single being (owing to a rigorous internal quality control process).</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> The Mechan construction process has been rigorously studied, and is the source of anxiety for some species, who do not wish to see their story repeated among their own kind. Many species have laws regarding the development of sentient automatons, and some outlaw the practice altogether.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Void Rumors:</strong> Among explorers and traders who explore deep into the Void, rumors abound of Mechans constructing a Dyson sphere-like object, deep within the folds of a secret nebula.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Recycling and Rebirth:</strong> Construction of a Mechan has historically only taken place when another Mechan is confirmed to have functioning or needs to be replaced. There is no evidence that Mechans have violated this central tenet of their core programming. As a result, a Mechan inherits most of its parts and programming from a previous Mechan. Nonetheless, it refers to itself as a unique individual with a unique iteration number.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Iterative Generations:</strong> Mechans generally use singular it/its pronouns, but increasingly, some use a collective we/our, suggesting a fundamental shift in consciousness. Mechans were not designed to be terribly creative. Some scientists suspect that some external force is accelerating Mechan evolution, but it would not be the first time organics underestimated the Mechans.</p>

			<p>Nekros are a mysterious combine species, composed of a parasitic intelligent fungus and a host body&mdash;preferably a deceased one with dextro-amino acids. The fungus spread throughout dead tissue, re-animating it, including some of brain function (although this appears related to the level of decomposition of the host body).</p>
			<p class="og-ind">This arrangement creates a new individual, capable forming new memories and preferences over time. Fledging Nekros imprint upon the individual that inspired their conversion as if they were a parent, and spend the first several years of their new lives learning from and in service to them. Lineage of creation is treated as if it were a family tree of sorts.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">It is a regular occurrence to see Nekros ships gathering in the wake of planetary mass extinction events and significant fleet battles in the Void&mdash;much to the dismay of the <a href="#descriptor-nirrex">Nirrex</a>&mdash;whose dextro-amino structure make them ideal candidates for conversion, and the <a href="#descriptor-humna-humna">Humna-humna</a>&mdash; who have lost valuable scavenging income. Qhil loathe and fear the Nekros for both reasons, in addition to anxieties around their precarious immune systems. Nekros have historically focused their conversion efforts on dextro-amino species like the Nirrex and Qhil, but have recent evidence suggests they are able to convert levo-amino species as well.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">As a culture, Nekros keep to themselves, and efforts to destroy their kind tend to be wasted. While <a href="#descriptor-asgardian">Asgardians</a>, Nirrex, <a href="#descriptor-thrynn">Thrynn</a> and <a href="#descriptor-scro">Scro</a> alike declare Nekros anathema, each has learned it better to avoid the Nekros than confront them, as Nekros have no reservation about using their "children" as cannon fodder, and because any losses only serve to bolster their ranks.

			<p>Nirrex are one of the more physically dangerous sapient species within the Void, and are born with natural talons on each of their three thick fingers. A metallic carapace surrounds their body, harboring trace amounts of Thulium, which wards against the intense solar radiation their home world of Navoril, which has an unusually weak magnetic field for a world with sapient life.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Nirrex typically stand over six feet tall, have two long, proportionately thick fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand, each tipped with talons, and sharp mandible jaw.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Nirrex tend toward a life of duty, service, and sacrifice, which makes them poor entrepreneurs. Nirrex society is regimented, organized, and disciplined. They pride themselves on recognizing what must be done, and following through.</p>

				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Ion Storms:</strong> Navoril has a metal-poor core, generating a weak magnetic field which allows more solar radiation into the atmosphere. To deal with this, most forms of life on the planet evolved some form of metallic coating or natural shielding to protect themselves.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Live Birth:</strong> Nirrex are viviparous, giving birth to live young. Men and women do not differ greatly in physical appearance, with crests around the temples, or swept back from the skull.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Blue Blood:</strong> Nirrex blood is dark blue.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Hard-Won Peace:</strong> Nirrex fought bloody wars among their own kind for centuries before unifying as a single starfaring people.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Social Strata:</strong> Throughout their lives, Nirrex ascend through a 19-tier social structure, with rights and responsibilities accorded to each rank. Stigma associated with demotion falls onto the individual who authorized a promotion, serving as a check on the promotion individuals into positions beyond their capabilities, and eliminating nepotism. An individual Nirrex settling into a role and rank is not considered stagnation, and most value accepting one's own limitations as more virtuous than rank ambition.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Client Race:</strong> The <a href="#descriptor-humna-humna">Humna-humna</a> serve as a client race of the Nirrex, offering their trade convoys security in exchange for their fiscal expertise and acumen. As a result of this agreement, Nirrex weapons frequently end up in the hands of mercenaries, pirates, and revolutionaries.</p>

			<p>During the Olnos home world's major industrial expansion a millennia ago, the already harsh, desert world began a swift descent into lifelessness due to an overexertion of natural resources. After two centuries of strife on the planet <a href="#descriptor-gazurtoid">Gazurtoid</a> evacuated a half-million Olnosi refugees to their home world of Chu'urn. Today, most Olnosi reside on ocean-covered worlds alongside their Gazurtoid saviors.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Because the Olnosi ancestors emerged from arid, rocky deserts, the humid, ocean-covered Gazurtoid home world of Chu'urn is tolerable only when the they stay inside a climate-controlled dome city. </p>
			<p class="og-ind">Exactly why the Gazurtoid saved the Olnosi from their fate&mdash;especially given their usual disposition regarding air-breathers&mdash;remains a mystery. Whatever additional insight Olnosi have about the Gazurtoid, they have kept it to themselves so far. Olnosi are not all spies and assassins for the Gazurtoid, but many are still treated with suspicion or fear.</p>

				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Ocular Implants:</strong> Many Olnosi apply genetic modification to their eyes to perceive higher frequency flashes of the Gazurtoid language.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Strange Syndrome:</strong> The leading cause of death for Olnosi on Chu'urn is caused by cumulative long-term exposure to a humid climate. It is noncommunicable, and Gazurtoid scientists claim to be working a cure.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> Olnosi memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall. These recalls are so vivid and detailed that Olnosi may mistake it for reality.</p>

			<p>The Qhil are a nomadic species of humanoid aliens known for their skills with technology and synthetic intelligence. Qhil resemble humans, but are shorter, slighter, with four thick fingers on each hand, and three toes on each foot, and the lower legs bowed backwards.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">The most distinguishing feature of Qhil biology is their weak immune system. As a result, all Qhil dress in highly sophisticated enviro-suits, and most have extensive cybernetic augmentations integrated into their bodies.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Three-hundred years ago, Qhil scientists created the Mechans to serve as an efficient source of manual labor. When their creations&mdash;the <a href="#descriptor-mechan">Mechans</a> gained sentience, the Qhil tried to destroy their creations, and the resulting war and forced Qhil into exile. Generations later, the surviving Qhil wander the Void in a flotilla of salvaged ships, secondhand vessels, and recycled technology, in search of a planet that where they can prosper without the aid of carefully contained environments.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Unusual Evolution:</strong> What few viruses and other microbes on Drochi were partly beneficial to the Qhil, giving them a symbiotic relationship with their environment, and making the loss of their home world even more devastating. Qhil immune systems have atrophied from generations in the sterile environment of space. Qhil are given various vaccinations and immunizations to help ward off disease, prefer the safety of their suits even in clean environments, and are reluctant to remove them without a good reason.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Immunology and Intimacy:</strong> As an intimate act, Qhil link suit environments. They will get sick, but adapt over time. The experience can bind two people together for life. A Qhil who wishes to remove their suit must take antibiotics and immuno-boosters for safely, and there are still inherent risks. As a result, physical acts of affection are difficult for Qhil, even for the purposes of reproduction and childbirth, and additional care is taken to preserve the cleanliness of such spaces.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Pilgrimage:</strong> Quil wander the Void on their own as a rite of passage into adulthood, with instructions not to return without something of value. This brings new technologies and efficiencies into the Qhil's vocabulary, while also alleviating the burden of the fleet's precarious resources, and establishes necessary population control. Through these pilgrimages, the Qhil still manage to compete technologically with other species.</p>

			<p>Scro are warriors who worship an ancestor-god of by the name of Dukgash, whom their home world is named. When the Scro had barely mastered the creation of steel, a people called the Hur'q attempted to conquer Dukgash. The Scro swore vengeance on the invaders, eventually hunting them to extinction with their own technology.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Today Scro's maintain a complex empire ruled by clans in a rigid caste system. Scro children learn to wield a weapon as soon as they can walk, making them capable combatants as adults. Scro marauders plague the trade routes of others, ambushing the unwary and pirating outer the spaces between one people's territory and another. They love stories, drinking, feasting, and song. They respect bravery, cunning, and those that keep their word.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">A few&mdash;usually those of the upper castes&mdash;are born with red or white skin, marking them from birth as leaders. Scro leaders tend to be cool-headed, tactical thinkers. They are aided by a series of ranks below them, including war-captains and battle-sorcerers. Scro regiments adorn themselves in black armor studded with steel, with deviations from uniform only being allowed as markers of a specific honor.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Lower-caste defectors and exiles make a life for themselves as adventurers. Only nobles and sages live to be elders.</p>

It is a grave insult to mistake one clan for another, and those that would deal with the Scro would do well to learn the differences.</p>

			<p>Spemin are an amoeboid race, whose bodies consist of three major parts: a large unicellular core their eyes, and their antennae. Spemin are largely amorphous, though their eyes and antennae are comparatively rigid structures. Their outer body surface is a characteristic deep blue color and is covered with many lobopodia, which are used mainly for propulsion, as well as many axopodia for ingestion of nutrients. One lobopodia located on their anterior is larger and more tubular than the others, providing propulsion and most other motor abilities. Spemin have twelve large, simple eyes located on their outer body wall. Spemin are capable of physically relocating their eyes to various points on their body's surface, giving them a highly variable field of vision (a Spemin can theoretically have 360 degrees of vision, or a much narrower field if all twelve eyes are pointed in the same direction).</p>
			<p class="og-ind">To put it simply, the Spemin are generally disliked by almost every people, largely due to their own actions and abrasive personalities. They are known to be liars and manipulators.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Spemin are most numerous, thanks to their small size and prodigious reproduction rates.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Ancient, Actually:</strong> Despite being otherwise thoroughly unimpressive, the Spemin are an ancient race, emerging not long after the <a href="#descriptor-dweenle">Dweenle</a> and <a href="#descriptor-elowarin">Elowarin</a>.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Twelve Eyes:</strong> Spemin can reposition their dozen eyes almost anywhere on their body, giving them the ability to see in all directions at once.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Spemin Dining:</strong> Spemin are omnivorous, and feed by phagocytosis; when they find suitable material to ingest, they wrap their bodies around it to begin ingestion.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Incomprehensible:</strong> The Spemin language&mdash;Whoopie&mdash;requires them to take in small amounts of air through their axopodia, which they then forcibly expel from their outer body wall, producing sounds ranging from high-pitched whines to something approaching human flatulence. It takes other species a great deal of time to understand even the basics of Spemin body language&mdash;let alone body language.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Kyriarchy:</strong> Spemin govern primarily by treachery and self-interest. The chaos spills out into almost every facet of Spemin life. What can be said? They love it.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Other Peoples:</strong> The <a href="#descriptor-gazurtoid">Gazurtoid</a> tolerate Spemin, believing the Spemin are kindred water breathers, or close enough. <a href="#descriptor-thrynn">Thrynn</a> find Spemin particularly disgusting, and regularly torment them using their superior technology.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Treacherous:</strong> When you expend Effort on a deception task, you gain a free level of Effort. Enabler.</p>
				<li><p><strong>Cousin Around Every Corner (1 XP):</strong> To say Spemin are numerous is an understatement, and you're never far from home when a cousin is nearby.

			<p>Tabriz are humanoids with powerful digitigrade legs, and sharp claws on the ends of four fingers and thumb. They have large ears, eyes, and noses, and are covered in furs of white, grey, gold, and black. Some have patches or stripes in their fur, and a few have accents on cheeks, tips of ears or other sensitive areas in cottony tufts of deep reds, purples, or blues.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Tabriz tend to be boisterous and adventurous, and integrate freely with others. Many Tabriz travel far from their place of birth in their younger years, and find their new families among other peoples&mdash;this practice is so commonplace that their governments provide stipends to those who stay on-world and start families to keep their birth rate sustainable.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">While Tabriz have a reputation for being easygoing, most have a well-developed sense of personal pride, and love to teach a lesson to anyone who would underestimate them.</p>

				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Abundant Home World:</strong> Breek is a twilit world of extremes: massive jungles, endless forests of high trees, expansive deserts, and snowy peaks cover most of the planet's surface, with a few small, shallow oceans separating three enormous continents. This arrangement provides ample room for Tabriz society, and mass conflict within their civilization has been an infrequent occurrence in their species' history.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Chaotic Policies:</strong> With no unified governing body to provide planetary security, several other species have thriving colonies in remote locations on the planet, including many less technologically advanced species. Recently, a coalition of scientists have emerged to voice concern for the long-term ecological health of Breek's planetary ecology.</p>

			<p>The Thrynn are reptilians with thick necks and graceful tails. Their bodies are compact and muscular, covered with tough leathery scales. They range in color from blue green to grey and orange.

Thrynn mate early in their second decade of life after a brief courtship, and with very limited exception, remain with the same partner their entire lives.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Thrynn do not concern themselves with hidden motives or grand mysteries, preferring to simply deal with things in as practical a manner as possible, even taking positions that seem cold and heartless to many other species. Thrynn believe the strong must band together and lead for each other's mutual advantage, including in commerce and military strategy. However, the weak do not figure prominently into their world. While Thrynn appreciate respect and diplomacy, they detest obsequiousness, and believe any race that debases itself is unworthy of survival, making the <a href="#descriptor-spemin">Spemin</a> and <a href="#descriptor-dweenle">Dweenle</a> frequent targets of their wrath.</p>

			<p>Yloi are natural genetic engineers, and are driven to seek out new lifeforms and trade with them to keep themselves from overspecializing and stagnating. They travel between the stars in immense living ships, and send down smaller ships as shuttles and to plant living communities.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Their third sex, Ahu, is the lynchpin of Yloi reproduction, as males and females have no specialized genital organs. Yloi females are larger than males, and Ahu are even smaller than males. Ahu are referred to by the neuter pronoun "it". All three sexes are typically aromantic, making practical decisions about their future and family group. Using a special organelle, Ahu take genetic material directly from others&mdash;which can be of <em>virtually any other species</em>&mdash;and assemble a viable zygote at the molecular level. Ahu then transplant the embryo to a host (of any sex and parent species). Gestation typically lasts 15 months.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Yloi society is non-hierarchical, although outsiders tend to think Ahu receive special deference. Conflict is rare, and usually resolved peacefully through peer pressure, psychological manipulation or going around the problem. They live on great living colony ships of their own species, which can contain several thriving, complex closed ecosystems. Yloi have long forgotten their home world, but rejoice when they meet another wandering tribe of their kind, eager to share what they have learned about life throughout the Void.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Uncanny and inscrutable to most races, the Yloi welcome outsiders among their kind, who usually generate significant local interest.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Organelle:</strong> Yloi have an organelle that was once an independent microscopic organism which entered a symbiotic relationship with the Yloi. It gifts them the ability to "taste" and assimilate others' genetics.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Animal Matter:</strong> Most Yloi consider eating animals and sentients immoral. Their digestion is highly efficient and produces almost no waste. </p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Tasting:</strong> Yloi have preferences for who and what they taste, but some provide great pleasure, and others less so.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Body Language:</strong> The position of an Yloi's sensory tentacles indicate their emotions. The tentacles smooth out against the body when they are pleased or happy, merge into cones pointed at people or things when interested, and knot when frustrated or frightened.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Artless:</strong> Yloi do not engage in literature, art, or music as cultural practice, as many other peoples do. They also have no religion other than the sacredness and continuity of life.</p>
				<p class="og-ind"><strong>Gazurtoid Treaty:</strong> Because they do not need to breathe air, Gazurtoid Church of Chu'urn considers Yloi exempt from their genocidal quest, and the two peoples enjoy a prosperous trade relationship.</p>

			<p>You gain the following characteristics:</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Evolved:</strong> +2 to your Might and Intellect pools.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Skill (Zero-G Maneuvering):</strong> You are trained in zero-gravity maneuvering.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Telescopic Sight:</strong> You can see in all directions and infrared and ultraviolet light frequencies. When you expend Effort on tasks that utilizes your sense of vision or ability to notice fine details, you gain a free level of Effort. Enabler.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Dreamfast Taste:</strong> You can taste a creature by touching it with one of your appendages. While in direct contact with other organics, you can share thoughts, emotions, and memories with creatures you are in physical contact with. Enabler.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Biological Insight:</strong> You can pick up on subtle biological cues like heartbeat, eye dilation and perspiration. This sense provides you two assets to tasks to determine another creature's motives or to determine if someone is lying. Enabler.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Void Adaptation:</strong> You can consume and be nourished by almost anything organic. You can breathe in water as easily as in air, and you can hold your breath for 24 hours. Enabler.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Bio-epigenetic Memory (1 XP):</strong> You are a living database of everything you have ever tasted. Even a small sample from a specimen&mdash;less than a drop of blood&mdash;can reveal quite a bit to you. You might be able to tell things like species, planet of origin, identify an individual creature with which you are familiar, or even make a medical diagnosis. If the GM determines you learn nothing useful, the XP isn't spent.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Inability (Amorphous):</strong> Your amorphous body makes wearing conventional clothing and armor impossible. You can fit a few possessions within your mass.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Inability (Disgusting):</strong> Your appearance and demeanor are disgusting to others. Pleasant social interaction tasks with creatures not accustomed to your kind are hindered by two steps.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:</strong> From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li>Choose another PC. Most other people are horrified by you, but not them. When the world seems overstimulating to you, they are there.</li>
				<li>Choose another PC. You are inexplicably drawn to them, and quiver at the thought of tasting their uniqueness.</li>
				<li>Choose another PC. You give them the creeps. No matter how hard you try, they don't want you near them.</li>
				<li>You are looking for exotic and hitherto untasted life to return with to your people.</li>

		<p>Some PCs with a <a href="#flavor-psionic">psionic flavor</a> find themselves conscripted into psionic cults, which style themsleves as military training programs, knightly orders, obscure covens, and despotic empires. Most conscripts end up <a href="index.html#type-warrior">warriors</a> or <a href="index.html#type-explorer">explorers</a>, but the highest eschelons of these organizations tend to be <a href="index.html#type-speaker">speakers</a> or <a href="index.html#type-adept">adepts</a>.</p>
		<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
			<li><p><strong>Joining a Cult:</strong> When a character is inducted into a cult, they choose one Rank 1 ability to gain. From then on, the character can spend 3 XP to gain another cult ability avalilable to their rank.</p>
			<li><p><strong>Ethos:</strong> Unlike <a href="index.html#modern-magic-covens">covens</a> <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 60)</span>, a character doesn't focus their cult abilities through a talisman&mdash;although many such cults do favor signature items, such as the <a href="index.html#fantastic-melee-weapon-plasma-saber">plasma saber</a> <span class="og-ref">(SF, 87)</span>. Instead, adherents cultivate a specific mental or emotional state to use their abilities, which is encapsulated in an ethos.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Rank Promotions:</strong> Most cults are structured around teacher-student relationships. Promotion to a higher rank usually involves a review from a council of higher-ranking members, or intensive one-on-one instruction from a master. Upon promotion, a character chooses one new ability available to their new rank to gain. Cult rank and character tier are two entirely different kinds of progress.</p>
			<li><p><strong>Joining Multiple Cults:</strong> A character can gain ranks in multiple cults, as long as they don't have an opposing ethos.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Breaking from a Cult:</strong> Those who stray from their ethos might lose abilities gained from the cult. The GM decides which abilities are lost (usually as part of a GM intrusion).</p></li>

			<p>Long after their remains have turned to dust, the spirit of an individual can linger still. There are as many reasons for a ghost to haunt the world as there are folk in it. Most ghosts awaken disoriented and must discover what it is that holds their attachment to the world of the living, as if discovering a final piece of themselves that they must confront before entering the next phase of their existence.</p>

They also retain all of their memories&mdash;and these, perhaps all too well.

		<li id="ability-unmaking">
			<p><strong>Unmaking (7+ Intellect points):</strong> You unmake a creature within immediate range. If the target is level 4 or lower, its body is destroyed, leaving behind only a fine dust. Its equipment and other possessions clatter to the ground. For each additional level of Effort you apply, you can increase the level of the target by 1.

		<li id="ability-able-assistance">
			<p><strong>Able Assistance:</strong> When you <a href="index.html#cooperative-actions">help</a> someone with a task and they apply a level of Effort, they get a <a href="index.html#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a> on that task. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-absorb-energy">
			<p><strong>Absorb Energy (7 Intellect points):</strong> You touch an object and absorb its energy. If you touch a manifest cypher, you render it useless. If you touch an artifact, roll for its depletion. If you touch another kind of powered machine or device, the GM determines whether its power is fully drained. In any case, you absorb energy from the object touched and regain 1d10 Intellect points. If this would give you more Intellect than your Pool's maximum, the extra points are lost, and you must make a Might defense roll. The difficulty of the roll is equal to the number of points over your maximum you absorbed. If you fail the roll, you take 5 points of damage and are unable to act for one round. You can use this ability as a defense action when you're the target of an incoming ability. Doing so cancels the incoming ability, and you absorb the energy as if it were a device. Action. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-absorb-kinetic-energy">
			<p><strong>Absorb Kinetic Energy:</strong> You absorb a portion of the energy of a physical attack or impact. You negate 1 point of damage you would have suffered and store that point as energy. Once you have absorbed 1 point of energy, you continue to negate 1 point of damage from any incoming blow or impact, but the residual energy bleeds off with a flare of harmless light (you cannot store more than 1 point at a time). Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-acrobatic-attack">
			<p><strong>Acrobatic Attack (1+ Speed points):</strong> You leap into the attack, twisting or flipping through the air. If you roll a natural 17 or 18, you can choose to have a <a href="index.html#special-rolls-minor-effect">minor effect</a> rather than deal extra damage. If you apply Effort to the attack, you get a <a href="index.html#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a> on the task. You can't use this ability if your <a href="index.html#equipment-using-armor">Speed Effort costs</a> are reduced from wearing armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-action-processor">
			<p><strong>Action Processor (4 Intellect points):</strong> Drawing upon stored information and the ability to process incoming data at amazing speeds, you are trained in one physical task of your choice for ten minutes. For example, you can choose running, climbing, swimming, Speed defense, or attacks with a specific weapon. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-adaptation">
			<p><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Thanks to a latent mutation, a device implanted in your spine, a ritual performed with dragon's blood, or some other gift, you now remain at a comfortable temperature; never need to worry about dangerous radiation, diseases, or gases; and can always breathe in any environment (even the vacuum of space). Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-advanced-command">
			<p><strong>Advanced Command (7 Intellect points):</strong> A target within short range obeys any command you give as long as they can hear and understand you. Further, as long as you continue to do nothing but issue commands (taking no other action), you can give that same target a new command. This effect ends when you stop issuing commands or they are out of short range. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-answering-attack">
			<p><strong>Answering Attack (3 Speed points):</strong> If you are struck in melee, you can make an immediate melee attack against that attacker once per round. The attack is hindered, and you can still take your normal action during the round. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-applying-your-knowledge">
			<p><strong>Applying Your Knowledge:</strong> When you <a href="index.html#cooperative-actions">help</a> another character undertake any action that you're untrained in, you are treated as if you are trained in it. Action. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-alleviate">
			<p><strong>Alleviate (3 Intellect points):</strong> You attempt to cancel or cure one malady (such as disease or poison) in one creature. Action. <span class="og-ref">(109)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-alley-rat">
			<p><strong>Alley Rat (6 Intellect points):</strong> While in a city, you find or create a significant shortcut, secret entrance, or emergency escape route where it looked like none existed. Doing so requires that you succeed on an Intellect action whose difficulty is set by the GM based on the situation. You and the GM should work out the details. Action. <span class="og-ref">(109)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-always-tinkering">
			<p><strong>Always Tinkering:</strong> If you have any tools and materials at all, and you are carrying fewer cyphers than your limit, you can create a <a href="index.html#manifest-cyphers">manifest cypher</a> if you have an hour of time to spend. The new cypher is random and always 2 levels lower than normal (minimum 1). It's also temperamental and fragile. These are called temperamental cyphers. If you give one to anyone else to use, it falls apart immediately, useless. Action to initiate; one hour to complete. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 48)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-amplify-sounds">
			<p><strong>Amplify Sounds (2 Might points):</strong> For one minute, you can amplify distant or small sounds so that you can hear them clearly, even if it's a conversation or the sound of a small animal moving through an underground burrow up to a very long distance away. You can attempt to perceive the sound even if interceding barriers block it or the sound is very slight, though this requires a few additional rounds of concentration. To discriminate the sound you wish in a noisy environment might also require a few additional rounds of concentration as you audibly explore the surrounding soundscape. Given enough time, you could pinpoint every conversation, every breathing creature, and every device creating noise within range. Action to initiate, up to several rounds to complete, depending on the difficulty of the task. <span class="og-ref">(109)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-annoy-electronics">
			<p><strong>Annoy Electronics (1 Intellect point):</strong> You interfere with the operations of an electronic device. The device must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Your interference is limited to things you could do in a few seconds if you were directly using the device. For example, you could make a person's phone start playing a loud video, type one or two commands on a computer's keyboard, hit a bunch of buttons in an elevator, or change the station or volume on a television screen. You must succeed at an Intellect-based task against the device or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you have never interacted with the particular device before, the task is hindered by two steps. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 74)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-arc-spray">
			<p><strong>Arc Spray (3 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow), you can fire your weapon at up to three targets (all next to one another) at once. Make a separate attack roll against each target. Each attack is hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-aquatic-combatant">
			<p><strong>Aquatic Combatant:</strong> You ignore penalties for any action (including fighting) in underwater environments. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-artifact-scavenger">
			<p><strong>Artifact Scavenger (6 Intellect points + 2 XP):</strong> You've developed a sixth sense for searching for the most valuable items in the wasteland. If you spend the time required to succeed on two scavenging tasks, you can exchange all the results you would otherwise obtain for a chance to gain an artifact of the GM's choosing if you succeed on a difficulty 6 Intellect task. You can use this ability at most once per day, and never within the same general area. Action to initiate, several hours to complete. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-artifact-tinkerer">
			<p><strong>Artifact Tinkerer:</strong> If you spend at least one day tinkering with an artifact in your possession, it functions at one level higher than normal. This applies to all artifacts in your possession, but they retain this bonus only for you. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-as-foretold-in-prophecy">
			<p><strong>As Foretold in Prophecy:</strong> You accomplish something that proves you are truly the chosen one. The next task you attempt is eased by three steps. You can't use this ability again until after you've taken a one-hour or a ten-hour recovery action. Action. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-assassin-skills">
			<p><strong>Assassin Skills:</strong> You are trained in stealth and disguise tasks. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-athlete">
			<p><strong>Athlete:</strong> You are trained in carrying, climbing, jumping, and smashing. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(111)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-attack-and-attack-again">
			<p><strong>Attack and Attack Again:</strong> Rather than granting additional damage or a <a href="index.html#special-rolls-minor-effect">minor</a> or <a href="index.html#special-rolls-major-effect">major effect</a>, a natural 17 or higher on your attack roll allows you the option of immediately making another attack. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(111)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-attack-flourish">
			<p><strong>Attack Flourish:</strong> With your attack, you add stylish moves, entertaining quips, or a certain something that entertains or impresses others. One creature you choose within short range who can see you gains an asset to its next task if taken within a round or two. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(111)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-autodoctor">
			<p><strong>Autodoctor:</strong> You are trained in healing, performing surgical procedures, and withstanding pain. You can perform surgeries on yourself, remaining conscious while you do so. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(111)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-awareness">
			<p><strong>Awareness (3 Intellect points):</strong> You become hyperaware of your surroundings in order to better locate your target. For ten minutes, you are aware of all living things within long range (including their general position), and by concentrating (another action), you can attempt to learn the general health and power level of any one of them. Action. <span class="og-ref">(111)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-bash">
			<p><strong>Bash (1 Might point):</strong> This is a pummeling melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal, but dazes your target for one round, during which time all tasks it performs are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-battlefield-tactician">
			<p><strong>Battlefield Tactician (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You scrutinize your surroundings, learning whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about attacking, defending, maneuvering, and dealing with environmental hazards within a short distance. For example, you might notice a pile of rubble you can stand on for an advantage in melee, a sheltered corner to help protect against enemy attacks, a less-slippery part of a frozen lake, or a place where the poison gas is thinner than elsewhere. If you (or someone you tell) move to that location, you (or they) gain an asset on tasks related to that optimal position (such as attack rolls from the high ground, Speed defense rolls from the sheltered corner, balance rolls on the frozen lake, or Might defense rolls against the poisonous cloud). Instead of gaining an advantageous location, you might learn of a disadvantageous location that you could use against your enemies, such as maneuvering them into an awkward corner that hinders their melee attacks or a weak spot on the frozen lake that will break if they stand on it. You can apply Effort to learn one additional good or bad location within range (one location per level of Effort), increase the range of this ability (another short distance per level of Effort), or both. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-beast-call">
			<p><strong>Beast Call (5 Intellect points):</strong> You summon a horde of small animals or a single level 4 beast to help you temporarily. These creatures do your bidding for as long as you focus your attention, but you must use your action each turn to direct them. Creatures are native to the area and arrive under their own power, so if you're in an unreachable place, this ability won't work. Action. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-beast-companion">
			<p><strong>Beast Companion:</strong> A level 2 creature of your size or smaller accompanies you and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you'll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The beast companion acts on your turn. As a level 2 creature, it has a target number of 6 and 6 health and it inflicts 2 points of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If your beast companion dies, you can hunt in the wild for 1d6 days to find a new one. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-betrayal">
			<p><strong>Betrayal:</strong> Any time you convince a foe that you are not a threat and then suddenly attack it (without provocation), the attack deals 4 additional points of damage. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(113)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-better-living-through-chemistry">
			<p><strong>Better Living Through Chemistry (4 Intellect points):</strong> You've developed drug cocktails specifically designed to work with your own biochemistry. Depending on which one you inject, it makes you smarter, faster, or tougher, but when it wears off, the crash is a doozy, so you use it only in desperate situations. You gain 2 to your Might Edge, Speed Edge, or Intellect Edge for one minute, after which you can't gain the benefit again for one hour. During this follow-up hour, every time you spend points from a Pool, increase the cost by 1. Action. <span class="og-ref">(113)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-biomorphic-detonation">
			<p><strong>Biomorphic Detonation (7+ Might points):</strong> You radiate a pulse of biomorphic energy up to a short distance away, but you tune it to disrupt life in an area an immediate distance across. All within the detonation take 5 points of damage that ignores Armor (unless it is Armor provided by a force field effect). If you apply additional Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(113)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-biomorphic-healing">
			<p><strong>Biomorphic Healing (4+ Might points):</strong> You consciously send out a pulse of your biomorphic field (a strange energy your body generates) and focus it on a living creature within short range. The target gains a free and immediate one-action <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>. You can't use this ability again on that creature until after its next ten-hour rest. Action. <span class="og-ref">(113)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-blackout">
			<p><strong>Blackout (3 Intellect points):</strong> You issue a disruptive ripple of energy within short range, creating an area where the electrical power grid fails. All devices relying on being plugged into the grid stop working. Battery-powered devices still work. Any standby generator connected in this area functions normally, activating emergency power within a few rounds. The blackout otherwise lasts for one minute. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 65)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-blessing-of-the-gods">
			<p><strong>Blessing of the Gods:</strong> As a servant of the gods, you can call up blessings in their name. This blessing depends on the god's general demeanor and area of influence. Choose two of the abilities described below.</p>
			<ul class="og-list-disc">
				<li><em>Authority/Law/Peace (3 Intellect points).</em> You prevent a foe that can hear and understand you from attacking anyone or anything for one round. Action.</li>
				<li><em>Benevolence/Righteousness/Spirit (2+ Intellect points).</em> One level 1 demon, spirit, or similar creature within short range is destroyed or banished. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to destroy or banish a level 5 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort. Action.</li>
				<li><em>Death/Darkness (2 Intellect points).</em> A target you choose within short range withers, suffering 3 points of damage. Action.</li>
				<li><em>Desire/Love/Health (3 Intellect points).</em> With a touch, you restore 1d6 points to one stat Pool of any creature, including yourself. This ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Each time you attempt to heal the same creature, the task is hindered by an additional step. The difficulty returns to 2 after that creature rests for ten hours. Action.</li>
				<li><em>Earth/Stone.</em> You are trained in climbing, stonecraft, and spelunking. Enabler.</li>
				<li><em>Knowledge/Wisdom (3 Intellect points).</em> Choose up to three creatures (potentially including yourself). For one minute, a particular type of task (but not an attack roll or defense roll) is eased for those creatures, but only while they remain within immediate range of you. Action.</li>
				<li><em>Nature/Animals/Plants.</em> You are trained in botany and handling natural animals. Enabler.</li>
				<li><em>Protection/Silence (3 Intellect points).</em> You create a quiet bubble of protection around you to an immediate radius for one minute. The bubble moves with you. All defense rolls for you and all creatures you designate within the bubble are eased, and no noise, regardless of its origin, sounds louder than a normal speaking voice. Action to initiate.</li>
				<li><em>Sky/Air (2 Intellect points).</em> A creature you touch is immune to airborne toxins or contaminants for ten minutes. Action.</li>
				<li><em>Sun/Light/Fire (2 Intellect points).</em> You cause one creature or object within short range to catch fire, inflicting 1 point of <a href="index.html#ambient-damage">ambient damage</a> each round until the fire is extinguished (requiring an action). Action.</li>
				<li><em>Trickery/Greed/Commerce.</em> You are trained in detecting the deceptions of other creatures. Enabler.</li>
				<li><em>War (1 Intellect point).</em> A target you choose within short range (potentially yourself) deals 2 additional points of damage with its next successful weapon attack. Action.</li>
				<li><em>Water/Sea (2 Intellect points).</em> A target you touch can breathe water for ten minutes. Action. <span class="og-ref">(114)</span></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-blinding-attack">
			<p><strong>Blinding Attack (3 Speed points):</strong> If you have a source of light, you can use it to make a melee attack against a target. If successful, the attack deals no damage, but the target is blinded for one minute. Action. <span class="og-ref">(115)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-block">
			<p><strong>Block (3 Speed points):</strong> You automatically block the next melee attack made against you within the next minute. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(115)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-blood-magician">
			<p><strong>Blood Magician:</strong> When you wish it, you can use points from your Might Pool rather than your Intellect Pool to activate a magical ability (including applying Effort to that ability). If you use your Might Pool this way, you use your Might Edge instead of your Intellect Edge. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 65)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-blurring-speed">
			<p><strong>Blurring Speed (7 Speed points):</strong> You move so quickly that until your next turn, you look like a blur. While you are blurred, if you apply Effort to a melee attack task or Speed defense task, you get a <a href="index.html#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a> on that task; you can move a short distance as part of another action or a long distance as your entire action. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(115)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-body-morph">
			<p><strong>Body Morph (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You alter your facial and bodily features and coloration for one hour, hiding your identity or impersonating someone. If you apply a level of Effort, you can imitate a specific person accurately enough to fool someone who knows them well or has observed them closely (including fingerprints and voice prints, but not their retina print or DNA). You have an asset in all tasks involving disguise (this is in addition to the asset from <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-face-morph">Face Morph</a>). You must apply a separate level of Effort to be able to impersonate a different species (such as a human morphing into a humanoid alien). Action. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 49)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-bolts-of-power">
			<p><strong>Bolts of Power (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You blast a fan of lightning out to short range in an arc that is approximately 50 feet (15 m) wide at the end. This discharge inflicts 4 points of damage. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than to ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(115)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-boost-manifest-cypher">
			<p><strong>Boost Manifest Cypher (2 Intellect points):</strong> The <a href="index.html#manifest-cyphers">manifest cypher</a> you activate with your next action functions as if it were 2 levels higher. Action. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 51)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-boost-manifest-cypher-function">
			<p><strong>Boost Manifest Cypher Function (4 Intellect points):</strong> Add 3 to the functioning level of a <a href="index.html#manifest-cyphers">manifest cypher</a> that you activate with your next action, or change one aspect of its parameters (range, duration, area, <em>etc.</em>) by up to double or down to one tenth. Action. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 51)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-bound-magic-familiar">
			<p><strong>Bound Magic Familiar:</strong> You have a <a href="index.html#modern-magic-magical-familiars">magic familiar</a> bound to you through a magical mark on your body (a tattoo, rune, scar, or something as mundane as a freckle or mole). Normally, the <a href="index.html#modern-magic-familiars">familiar</a> remains sleeping in its spiritual form. When you use an action to manifest them, they appear next to you as a creature with a specific form (such as a cat, hawk, homunculus, tiny dragon, or other suitable magical creature) and can communicate with you telepathically. The familiar is friendly toward you but has its own personality determined by the GM.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">The familiar can remain physically manifested for up to one hour, after which they return to their sleeping spiritual form and cannot manifest again until after your next ten-hour <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>. While manifested, they accompany you and follow your instructions. The familiar must remain within an immediate distance of you; if they move farther away, they are yanked back into their magical mark at the end of your following turn and cannot return until after your next ten-hour recovery roll. The familiar doesn't make attacks, but they can use their action to grant you an asset for any one attack you make on your turn. Otherwise, they can take actions on their own (though you'll likely roll for them).</p>
			<p class="og-ind">If the familiar is reduced to 0 health, they dissipate into their spiritual form and cannot manifest again until 1d6 + 2 days have passed.</p>

		<li id="ability-brainwashing">
			<p><strong>Brainwashing (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You use trickery, well-spoken lies, and mind-affecting chemicals (or other means, like magic or high technology) to make others temporarily do what you want them to do. You control the actions of another creature you touch. This effect lasts for one minute. The target must be level 3 or lower. You can allow it to act freely or override its control on a case-by-case basis as long as you can see it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to control the mind of a level 6 target (three levels above the normal limit) or control a target for four minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must apply three levels of Effort. When the duration ends, the creature doesn't remember being controlled or anything it did while under your influence. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-break-their-mind">
			<p><strong>Break Their Mind (7+ Intellect points):</strong> Using your clever words and knowledge of others, and given a couple of rounds of conversation to gain a few specific pieces of context regarding your target, you can utter a sentence designed to cause your target immediate psychological distress. If the target can hear and understand you, it suffers 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and forgets the last day of its life, which might mean it forgets you and how it came to be where it currently is. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to attempt to break the mind of one additional target who can hear and understand you.

			<p><strong>Break the Ranks (6 Speed points):</strong> You move up to a short distance and attack up to four different foes as a single action as long as they are all along your path. Any modifiers that apply to one attack apply to all the attacks you make. If you have another special ability that allows you to move and take an action, when you use Break the Ranks, you gain an asset to attacking these foes. Action. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-breaker">
			<p><strong>Breaker:</strong> You are trained in tasks related to damaging objects with the goal of breaking, piercing, or demolishing them. It is a Might action to damage an object, and on a success, the object moves one step down the <a href="index.html#special-situation-attacking-objects">object damage track</a>. If the Might roll exceeds the difficulty by two steps, the object instead moves two steps down the object damage track. If the Might roll exceeds the difficulty by four steps, the object moves three steps down the object damage track and is immediately destroyed. Brittle material reduces the effective level of the object, while hard material like wood or stone adds 1 to the effective level or 2 for very hard objects like those made of metal. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Buddy System (3 Intellect points):</strong> Choose one character standing next to you. That character becomes your buddy for ten minutes. You are trained in all tasks involving finding, healing, interacting with, and protecting your buddy. Also, while you stand next to your buddy, both of you have an asset on Speed defense tasks. You can have only one buddy at a time. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-bypass-barrier">
			<p><strong>Bypass Barrier (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You get past a door, force field, or other barrier up to 3 feet (1 m) thick that is blocking your way. Depending on the barrier, this might involve finding a weak spot you can push through, pressing the right button by luck, just breaking through, or even weirder explanations like touching a thin place between dimensions or an unexpected interaction with your equipment. The difficulty of the task is the level of the barrier. This ability allows you alone to pass through, not anyone else, and the way through closes at the end of your turn (which might mean you're trapped on the far side). You have an asset in any attempts to get through it again. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum thickness of the barrier, each level adding 3 feet (1 m). Action. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Call Otherworldly Spirit (6 Intellect points):</strong> You summon a spirit creature that manifests for up to a day (or less, if it accomplishes something important to it before then), after which it fades away and cannot be summoned again. The spirit is a creature of level 6 or lower, and it can be substantial or insubstantial as it wishes (using an action to change). The spirit is not beholden to you, and it does not need to stay near you to remain manifest. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(117)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-calm-stranger">
			<p><strong>Calm Stranger (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You can cause one intelligent creature to remain calm as you speak. The creature doesn't need to speak your language, but it must be able to see you. It remains calm as long as you focus all your attention on it and it is not attacked or otherwise threatened. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to calm additional creatures allied with your initial target, one additional creature per level of Effort applied. Action. <span class="og-ref">(118)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-captivate-or-inspire">
			<p><strong>Captivate or Inspire:</strong> You can use this ability in one of two ways. Either your words keep the attention of all NPCs that hear them for as long as you speak, or your words inspire all NPCs that hear them to function as if they were one level higher for the next hour. In either case, you choose which NPCs are affected. If anyone in the crowd is attacked while you're trying to speak to them, you lose the crowd's attention. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(118)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-captivate-with-starshine">
			<p><strong>Captivate With Starshine:</strong> For as long as you speak, you keep the attention of all level 2 or lower NPCs who can hear you.

		<li id="ability-careful-shot">
			<p><strong>Careful Shot:</strong> You can spend points from either your Speed Pool or your Intellect Pool to apply levels of Effort to increase your gun damage. Each level of Effort adds 3 points of damage to a successful attack, and if you spend a turn lining up your shot, each level of Effort instead adds 5 points of damage to a successful attack. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(118)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-cast-illusion">
			<p><strong>Cast Illusion:</strong> You can increase the range at which you create and maintain your immediate-range illusions (such as from <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-minor-illusion">Minor Illusion</a>) to anywhere within short range that you can perceive.

		<li id="ability-castigate">
			<p><strong>Castigate (4 Intellect points):</strong> You intimidate any opponent within long range who understands speech (even if it is not your language) so much that they lose their next action and all the rest of their actions are hindered for one minute. Each additional time you attempt this ability against the same target, you must apply one more level of Effort than you applied on the previous attempt. Action. <span class="og-ref">(118)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-change-the-paradigm">
			<p><strong>Change the Paradigm (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You sway the worldview of a creature you spend at least one round speaking to, as long as it can understand you. The creature changes its mind on a significant belief, which could include something as straightforward as helping you instead of trying to kill you, or it could be something more esoteric. This effect lasts for at least ten minutes, but it can last longer if the creature wasn't previously your foe. During this time, the creature takes actions in accordance with the wisdom you have imparted to it. The target must be level 2 or lower. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target by one for each level of Effort applied. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(119)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-cloak-of-opportunity">
			<p><strong>Cloak of Opportunity (5 Intellect points):</strong> You set small objects from the environment (rocks, broken items, clumps of dirt, and so on) swirling about you for up to ten minutes, which grants you +2 Armor. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(119)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-cloud-personal-memories">
			<p><strong>Cloud Personal Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> If you interact with or study a target for at least a round, you gain a sense of how its mind works, which you can use against it in the most blunt fashion possible. You can attempt to confuse it and make it forget what's just happened. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory. Action to prepare; action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(119)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Cognizant Offense:</strong> During combat, your brain shifts into a sort of battle mode where all potential attacks you could make are plotted on vector graphs in your mind's eye, which always provides the best option. Your attacks are eased. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(119)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-control-weather">
			<p><strong>Control Weather (10 Intellect points):</strong> You change the weather in your general region. If performed indoors, this creates minor effects, such as mist, mild temperature changes, and so on. If performed outside, you can create rain, fog, snow, wind, or any other kind of normal (not overly severe) weather. The change lasts for a natural length of time so that a storm might last for an hour, fog for two or three hours, and snow for a few hours (or for ten minutes if it's out of season). For the first ten minutes after activating this ability, you can create more dramatic and specific effects, such as lightning strikes, giant hailstones, twisters, hurricane-force winds, and so on. These effects must occur within 1,000 feet (300 m) of your location. You must spend your turn concentrating to create an effect or maintain it in a new round. These effects inflict 6 points of damage each round. If you have this ability from another source, the cost for the ability is 7 Intellect points instead of 10. If you already have the <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-storm-seed">Storm Seed</a> ability, you can immediately replace it with a new ability of the same tier. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(122)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-comfort-and-encouragement">
			<p><strong>Comfort and Encouragement (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You speak to a non-hostile creature within short range, telling them exactly what they need to hear to have a better day. You don't know what these words are until you say them, but you know they will help the creature's attitude. If the creature spends a round or two thinking about what you said, they gain an asset on one task of their choosing within one hour. Alternatively, if the creature has an ongoing penalty to tasks (such as having a hangover, sadness from a recent fight with their romantic partner, an injury, or a stressful situation at work), they can ignore that penalty for the next hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more creatures; each level of Effort affects one additional creature. Action to initiate; up to one minute to complete. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 71)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-command">
			<p><strong>Command (3 Intellect points):</strong> Through sheer force of will, you can issue a simple imperative command to a single living creature, who then attempts to carry out your command as its next action. The creature must be within short range and able to understand you. The command can't inflict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so "Commit suicide" won't work, but "Flee" might. In addition, the command can require the creature to take only one action, so "Unlock the door" might work, but "Unlock the door and run through it" won't. A commanded creature can still defend itself normally and return an attack if one is made on it. If you possess another ability that allows you to command a creature, you can target two creatures at once as your base effect if you use either ability. Action. <span class="og-ref">(120)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-command-spirit">
			<p><strong>Command Spirit (3 Intellect points):</strong> You can command a spirit or animated dead creature of up to level 5 within short range.

			<p><strong>Concussion (7 Intellect points):</strong> You cause a pulse of concussive force to explode out from a point you choose within long range.

			<p><strong>Concussive Blast (2 Intellect points):</strong> You release a beam of pure force that smashes into a creature within short range, inflicting 5 points of damage and moving it back an immediate distance. Action. <span class="og-ref">(121)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-confidence-artist">
			<p><strong>Confidence Artist:</strong> When you're hacking into a computer system, running a con, picking a pocket, fooling or tricking a dupe, sneaking something by a guard, and so on, you gain an asset on the task. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(121)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-confounding-banter">
			<p><strong>Confounding Banter (4 Intellect points):</strong> You spew a stream of nonsense to distract a foe within immediate range. On a successful Intellect roll, your defense roll against the creature's next attack before the end of the next round is eased. Action. <span class="og-ref">(121)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-confuse-enemy">
			<p><strong>Confuse Enemy (4 Intellect points):</strong> Through a clever bit of misdirection involving a flourish of your coat, ducking at just the right moment, or a similar stratagem, you can attempt to redirect a physical melee attack that would otherwise hit you. When you do, the misdirected attack hits another creature you choose within immediate range of both you and the attacking foe. This ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(121)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-counter-danger">
			<p><strong>Counter Danger (4 Intellect points):</strong> You negate a source of potential danger related to one creature or object within immediate distance for one minute (instead of one round, as with <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-foil-danger">Foil Danger</a>). This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a creature's natural ability, or a trap triggered by a pressure plate. You can also try to counter an action (like moving or making a conventional mundane attack with a weapon, a claw, <em>etc.</em>). Action. <span class="og-ref">(122)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-countercharm">
			<p><strong>Countercharm (5 Intellect points):</strong> If you are affected by an unwanted ongoing magical condition or affliction (such as a curse, paralysis spell, withering hex, and so on) that gives you additional rolls to end it early, your rolls to end it early are eased by two steps until you break free. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 49)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-countermeasures">
			<p><strong>Countermeasures (4 Intellect points):</strong> You immediately end one ongoing effect (such as an effect created by a character ability) within immediate range. Alternatively, you can use this as a defense action to cancel any incoming ability targeted at you, or you can cancel any device or the effect of any device for 1d6 rounds.

			<p><strong>Continuous Transfer:</strong> When you use either <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-drain-creature">Drain Creature</a> or <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-tap-currents">Tap Currents</a> to drain energy, you can transfer it to another creature within short range, restoring points to their Might or Speed Pools (or health for an NPC). This occurs seamlessly, as part of the same action. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 59)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-contortionist">
			<p><strong>Contortionist (2 Speed points):</strong> You can wriggle free from bindings or squeeze through a tight spot. You are trained in escaping.

			<p><strong>Controlled Fall:</strong> When you fall while you are able to use actions and within reach of a vertical surface, you can attempt to slow your fall.

		<li id="ability-critter-companion">
			<p><strong>Critter Companion:</strong> A level 1 creature accompanies you and follows your instructions. This creature is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg) and is normally some sort of domesticated species. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you'll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The critter companion acts on your turn. As a level 1 creature, it has a target number of 3 and 3 health, and it inflicts 1 point of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If your critter companion dies, you can search an urban or wild environment for 1d6 days to find a new one. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(123)</span></p>

If given a week and the right tools, chemicals, and parts, you can tinker with one of your manifest cyphers, transforming it into another cypher of the same type that you had in the past. The GM and player should collaborate to ensure that the transformation is logical&mdash;for example, you probably can't transform a pill into a helmet. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(124)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Danger Instinct (3 Speed points):</strong> If you are attacked by surprise, whether by a creature, a device, or simply an environmental hazard (a tree falling on you), you can move an immediate distance before the attack occurs. If moving prevents the attack, you are safe.

You can affect a target within long range that you can see, or a target within 10 miles (16 km) that you have hair or skin clippings from. To all outward appearances, an affected target stands (or lies) unmoving. But inside, the substituted reality (or dream within a dream, if the target was sleeping) is what the target experiences. If the target is under duress, it can attempt another Intellect defense roll each round to break free, though the target may not realize its state. Either the dream unfolds according to a script you prepared when you used this ability, or if you use your own actions (forcing you into a similar state as the target), you can direct the unfolding dream from round to round. Using this ability on a sleeping target eases the initial attack. Action to initiate; if you direct the dream, action to direct per round. <span class="og-ref">(124)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Deactivate Mechanisms (5+ Speed points):</strong> You make a melee attack that inflicts no damage against a machine. Instead, if the attack hits, make a second Speed-based roll.

If you have the <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-scramble-machine">Scramble Machine</a> or <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-disable-mechanisms">Disable Mechanisms</a> ability (or an ability that works similarly), when you apply a level of Effort to any of them, you gain an additional <a href="index.html#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a>.

		<li id="ability-deep-consideration">
			<p><strong>Deep Consideration (6 Intellect points):</strong> When you develop a plan that involves you and your friends working together to accomplish a goal, you can ask the GM one very general question about what is likely to happen if you carry out the plan, and you will get a simple, brief answer.

			<p><strong>Defense Master:</strong> Every time you succeed at a Speed defense task, you can make an immediate attack against your foe. (If you have <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-dodge-and-respond">Dodge and Respond</a>, you can exchange that ability for <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-dodge-and-resist">Dodge and Resist</a>.) Your attack must be the same type (melee weapon, ranged weapon, or unarmed) as the attack you defend against. If you don't have an appropriate type of weapon ready, you can't use this ability. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-defensive-field">
			<p><strong>Defensive Field:</strong> Thanks to subdermal implants, a permanent spell, alien modifications, or something similar, you now have a force field that radiates 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your body and provides you with +2 Armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-defensive-phasing">
			<p><strong>Defensive Phasing (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can change your phase so that some attacks pass through you harmlessly.

			<p><strong>Define Down (4 Intellect points):</strong> The natural gravity within an area a short distance across that you are within immediate range of changes directions so that it flows in the direction you determine (up, up and to the south, west, and so on) for a few seconds, then snaps back.

			<p><strong>Defuse Situation:</strong> During the course of an investigation, your questions sometimes elicit an angry or even violent response. Through dissembling, verbal distraction, or similar evasion, you prevent a living foe from attacking anyone or anything for one round. Action. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-designation">
			<p><strong>Designation:</strong> You assign an innocent or guilty label to one creature within immediate range, based on your assessment of a given situation or a predominant feeling. In other words, someone who is labeled innocent can be innocent in a certain circumstance, or they can be generally innocent of terrible crimes (such as murder, major theft, and so on). Likewise, you can declare that a creature is guilty of a particular crime or of terrible deeds in general. The accuracy of your assessment isn't important as long as you believe it to be the truth; the GM may require you to give a rationale. Henceforth, your tasks to socially interact with someone you designate as innocent gain an asset, and your attacks against those you designate as guilty gain an asset. You can change your assessment, but it requires another designation action. The benefits of the designation last until you change it or until you are shown proof that it is wrong. Action. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Destined for Greatness:</strong> You enjoy uncanny luck as if something was watching over you and keeping you from harm. When you would otherwise descend a step on <a href="index.html#the-damage-track">the damage track</a>, make an Intellect defense roll versus the difficulty set by the level of the foe or effect. If you succeed, you do not descend that step. If the step was because you fell to 0 points in a Pool, you are still at 0 points; you just don't suffer the negative effects of being impaired or debilitated. If you would otherwise descend the final step on the damage track to death, a successful defense roll keeps you at 1 point in one Pool, and you remain debilitated. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Destroyer (6 Might points):</strong> If you succeed on a Might task to damage an object, instead of descending one step on the <a href="index.html#special-situation-attacking-objects">object damage track</a>, the object descends all three steps and is destroyed. Action. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-detect-life">
			<p><strong>Detect Life (3+ Might points):</strong> You consciously send out a pulse of your life energy. You detect all living creatures within short range, even if they are behind cover, though not if they're behind a force field. When you detect a creature, you detect its general location (to within an immediate range). If you apply two additional levels of Effort, you can increase the range of detection to long.

		<li id="ability-disarming-attack">
			<p><strong>Disarming Attack (5 Speed points):</strong> You attempt a Speed task to disarm a foe as part of your melee attack. If you succeed, your attack inflicts 3 additional points of damage and the target's weapon is knocked from their grip, landing up to 20 feet (6 m) away. If you fail, you still attempt your normal attack, but you don't inflict the extra damage or disarm the opponent if you hit. Action. <span class="og-ref">(129)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Dispel Magic (2+ Intellect points):</strong> Choose one magical effect within long range. An effect of up to level 3 ends if you succeed on an Intellect-based attack roll against the level of the effect, or against the level of the creature or object the magical effect affects, whichever is higher. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can apply Effort to increase the level of the effect that can potentially be dispelled. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 75)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-divine-intervention">
			<p><strong>Divine Intervention (2 Intellect points, or 2 Intellect points + 4 XP):</strong> You ask the divine to intervene on your behalf, usually against a creature within long range, changing the course of its life in a small way by introducing a major special effect upon it. The major special effect is akin to what occurs when you roll a natural 20 on an attack. If you want to try for a larger effect, and if the GM allows it, you can attempt a divine intervention with a more far-reaching effect, which is more like the kind of <a href="index.html#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> initiated by the GM on their players. In this case, Divine Intervention also costs 4 XP, the effect may not work out exactly like you hope, and you may not make another plea for divine intervention for a week. Action. <span class="og-ref">(130)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-dodge-and-resist">

			<p><strong>Double Strike (3 Might points):</strong> When you wield two weapons, you can choose to make one attack roll against a foe.

		</li>
		<li id="ability-drain-machine">
			<p><strong>Drain Machine (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You can drain the power from an artifact or powered device you touch. If the target is a robot, you inflict 3 points of damage and restore 3 points to your Might or Speed Pool. If the target is an object, you restore points to your Might or Speed Pool equal to the level of the target. If the target is a manifest cypher, it is fully drained and useless. Artifacts and similar devices must immediately check for depletion (items with a depletion of "&mdash;" are either immune to this ability or have a depletion of 1 in 1d10 when attacked with this ability). Action. <span class="og-ref">(131)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-drain-power">
			<p><strong>Drain Power (5 Speed points):</strong> You affect the main power source of a robot or machine, inflicting upon it all four conditions in <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-disable-mechanisms">Disable Mechanisms</a> at once. You must touch the robot to do this (if you are making an attack, it inflicts no damage). Action. <span class="og-ref">(131)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-draw-conclusion">
			<p><strong>Draw Conclusion (3 Intellect points):</strong> After careful observation and investigation (questioning one or more NPCs on a topic, searching an area or a file, and so on) lasting a few minutes, you can learn a pertinent fact. This ability is a difficulty 3 Intellect task. Each additional time you use this ability, the task is hindered by an additional step. The difficulty returns to 3 after you rest for ten hours. Action. <span class="og-ref">(131)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-drawing-on-lifes-experiences">
			<p><strong>Drawing on Life's Experiences (6 Intellect points):</strong> You've seen a lot and done a lot, and that experience comes in handy. Ask the GM one question, and you'll receive a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Action. <span class="og-ref">(131)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Dual Light Wield:</strong> You can use two light weapons at the same time, making two separate attacks on your turn as a single action. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action, but because you make separate attacks, your opponent's Armor applies to both. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to both attacks, unless it's specifically tied to one of the weapons. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(132)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-dual-medium-wield">
			<p><strong>Dual Medium Wield:</strong> You can use two light weapons or medium weapons at the same time (or one light weapon and one medium weapon), making two separate attacks on your turn as a single action.

		</li>
		<li id="ability-duel-to-the-death">
			<p><strong>Duel to the Death (5 Speed points):</strong> Choose a target (a single individual creature that you can see). You are trained in all tasks involving fighting that creature. When you successfully attack that target, you inflict +5 damage, or +7 damage if the creature is engaging someone else instead of you. You can duel only one creature at a time. A duel lasts up to one minute, or until you break it off. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(132)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-dust-to-dust">
			<p><strong>Dust to Dust (7 Intellect points):</strong> You disintegrate one object that is smaller than you and whose level is less than or equal to your tier. You must touch the object to affect it. If the GM feels it appropriate to the circumstances, you can disintegrate a portion of an object (the total volume of which is smaller than you) rather than the entire thing. Action. <span class="og-ref">(133)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-eclipse">
			<p><strong>Eclipse (2 Intellect points):</strong> You drain the light from an immediate area within long range. Bright light (like a sunny day outdoors) becomes dim light, normal light (like inside a well-lit room) becomes very dim light, and anything darker becomes darkness. If you cast this spell on an object, the darkness moves with the object, and can be suppressed if it is enclosed in a light-proof container or wrapping. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 50)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-endurance">
			<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Any duration dealing with physical actions is either doubled or halved, whichever is better for you. For example, if the typical person can hold their breath for thirty seconds, you can hold it for one minute. If the typical person can march for four hours without stopping, you can do so for eight hours. In terms of harmful effects, if a poison paralyzes its victims for one minute, you are paralyzed for thirty seconds. The minimum duration is always one round. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(134)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Effective Skill:</strong> Choose one noncombat skill when you gain this ability.

You get a <a href="index.html#special-rolls-major-effect">major effect</a> with that skill when you roll a natural 19 or higher (the d20 shows "19" or higher).

		</li>
		<li id="ability-embrace-the-night">
			<p><strong>Embrace the Night (7+ Intellect points):</strong> You fashion a truly horrifying facade of a creature from swirling ribbons of dark matter and launch it at your foes within long range. Each round, you can attack a target within long range using the creation as your weapon. When you attack, the creature inserts hair-fine tendrils of shadow into the target's eyes and brain. The target takes 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and is stunned for one round so that it loses its next turn. Alternatively, you can cause the creature to take other actions, as long as you are able to see it and mentally control it as your action. The creature disperses after about a minute. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(133)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-embraced-by-darkness">
			<p><strong>Embraced by Darkness (6 Intellect points):</strong> For the next hour, you take on some characteristics of a shadow thanks to a fundamental adaptation of your flesh or a device you've kept secret. Your appearance is a dark silhouette. When you apply a level of Effort to sneaking tasks, you get a <a href="index.html#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a> on the task. During this time, you can move through the air at a rate of a short distance per round, and you can move through solid barriers (even those that are sealed to prevent the passage of light or shadow), but not energy barriers, at a rate of 1 foot (30 cm) per round. You can perceive while passing through a barrier or object, which allows you to peek through walls. As a shadow, you can't affect or be affected by normal matter. Likewise, you can't attack, touch, or otherwise affect anything. However, attacks and effects that rely on light can affect you, and sudden bursts of light can potentially make you lose your next turn. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(133)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-emotional-support-pet">
			<p><strong>Emotional Support Pet (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You conjure an adorable animal that most people find irresistibly cute, such as a puppy, kitten, or bunny, who is outgoing and friendly and otherwise acts according to its nature. Anyone in short range who can see the animal eases their defense tasks against negative feelings (such as anger, fear, sadness, and worry) for the next hour. Anyone who pets, cuddles, or plays with this animal for at least a round or two (up to four people can do so at once) feels happier for the next hour and adds +1 to any recovery rolls they make during that time. At the end of the spell, the conjured animal curls up, falls asleep, and disappears in a puff of smoke. If the animal is harmed in any way, anyone who saw it happen eases all rolls against the creature responsible for the harm. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can conjure three additional animals for each level of Effort you apply to this ability. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 72)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Energize Object:</strong> By focusing your <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-absorb-kinetic-energy">Absorb Kinetic Energy</a> ability on an object (like a weapon), you infuse it with your power. The object holds the energy until it is touched by anyone but you, so putting it into your melee weapon or the ammo of a ranged weapon allows the weapon to trigger the energy in combat. The energy inflicts 3 points of damage on the creature touched in addition to any damage the weapon itself might do. You cannot have more than one energized object on your person at a time. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(134)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Energy Protection (3+ Intellect points):</strong> Choose a discrete type of energy that you have experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You gain +10 to Armor against damage from that type of energy for ten minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor against damage from that energy for 24 hours. You must be familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience with a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you can't protect against it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to protect more targets; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to two additional targets.

		<li id="ability-enhanced-body">
			<p><strong>Enhanced Body:</strong> Your machine parts grant you +1 to Armor, +3 to your Might Pool, and +3 to your Speed Pool. Traditional healing skills, medicines, and techniques work only half as well for you. Each time you start at full health, the first 5 points of damage you take can never be healed in these ways or recovered normally. Instead, you must use repairing skills and abilities to restore those points. For example, if you start with a full Might Pool of 10 and take 8 points of damage, you can use <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery rolls</a> to restore 3 points, but the remaining 5 points must be restored with repair tasks.

			<p><strong>Enlarge (1+ Might point):</strong> You trigger an enzymatic reaction that draws additional mass from another dimension, and you (and your clothing or suit) grow larger. You achieve a height of 9 feet (3 m) and stay that way for about a minute. During that time, you add 4 points to your Might Pool, add +1 to Armor, and add +2 to your Might Edge . While you are larger than normal, your Speed defense rolls are hindered, and you are practiced in using your fists as heavy weapons.</p>

After spending 24 hours with you, once per day, each of your friends can ease a particular task by two steps. This benefit is ongoing while you remain in your friends' company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to your friends' company within 24 hours.

			<p><strong>Extra Use (3 Intellect points):</strong> You attempt to gain an extra use from an artifact without triggering a depletion roll. The difficulty of the task is equal to the level of the artifact. If you crafted the artifact, you gain an asset to the task. On a failure, the depletion roll occurs normally.

			<p><strong>Face Morph (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You alter your features and coloration for one hour, hiding your identity or impersonating someone.

			<p><strong>Facsimile of Life (3 Intellect points):</strong> You give an object limited mobility, awareness, and intellect, allowing it to move about as if it were a small pet. The object must be within immediate distance and no larger than half your size. When animated, the object can perform tasks for you as if it were a level 1 creature, but otherwise is treated as an object of its level (for example, it uses the object damage track instead of health). The animation lasts for an hour or until you and it are at least a long distance apart, at which time the object becomes inert again. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 66)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Fast Talk (1 Intellect point):</strong> When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn't hostile, you convince that creature to take one reasonable action in the next round.

			<p><strong>Fearsome Reputation (3 Intellect points):</strong> You and those you travel with have earned a fearsome reputation in some parts.

			<p><strong>Final Defiance:</strong> When you would normally be dead, you instead remain conscious and active for one more round plus one additional round each time you succeed on a difficulty 5 Might task. During these rounds, you are debilitated. If you do not receive healing or otherwise gain points in a Pool during your final round(s) of activity, you are subject to the effects of <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-not-dead-yet">Not Dead Yet</a>.

		<li id="ability-find-the-hidden">
			<p><strong>Find the Hidden (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You see the traceries of objects as they move through space and time. You can sense the distance and direction of any specific inanimate object that you once touched. This takes anywhere from one action to hours of concentration, depending on what the GM feels is appropriate due to time, distance, or other mitigating circumstances. However, you don't know in advance how long it will take. If you use at least two levels of Effort, once you have established the distance and direction, you remain in contact with the object for one hour per level of Effort used. Thus, if it moves, you are aware of its new position. Action to initiate; action each round to concentrate. <span class="og-ref">(140)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-flamboyant-boast">
			<p><strong>Flamboyant Boast (1 Intellect point):</strong> You boastfully describe an act that you will accomplish, and then as part of the same action, you attempt it. If an average person would find the action difficult (or impossible) and you succeed on it, creatures who witnessed it who are not your allies are potentially dazed on their next turn, and all tasks they attempt are hindered. The GM will help you determine whether your boast is something that would impress onlookers so significantly. If you attempt the task you boast about but fail to accomplish it, all your attempts to affect or attack onlookers who saw you are hindered for about ten minutes. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(140)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-flash">
			<p><strong>Flash (4 Intellect points):</strong> You create an explosion of energy at a point within close range, affecting an area up to immediate range from that point. You must be able to see the location where you intend to center the explosion. The blast inflicts 2 points of damage to all creatures or objects within the area. If you apply Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll.

		<li id="ability-fleet-of-foot">
			<p><strong>Fleet of Foot (1+ Speed points):</strong> You can move a short distance as part of another action. You can move a long distance as your entire action for a turn.

			<p><strong>Flying Companion:</strong> You gain a level 3 companion creature that can fly at the same speed as you; depending on other aspects of your character, this might be a trained bird, a machine drone, or a helpful strange creature such as a familiar.

This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a trap triggered by a pressure plate, or a creature's natural ability (something special, innate, and dangerous, like a dragon's fiery breath or a giant cobra's venom). You can also try to foil a foe's mundane action (such as an attack with a weapon or claw), so that the action isn't made this round. Make your roll against the level of the attack, danger, or creature. Action. <span class="og-ref">(142)</span></p>

If you apply one level of Effort, you can also walk on the ceiling or on a liquid or semi-liquid surface such as water, mud, quicksand, or even lava (although touching a dangerous surface like lava still harms you).

			<p><strong>Infer Thoughts (4 Intellect points):</strong> If you interact with or study a target for at least a round, you can attempt to read its surface thoughts, even if the subject doesn't want you to.

			<p><strong>Information Gathering (5 Intellect points):</strong> You speak telepathically with any or all machines within 1 mile (1.5 km).

		<li id="ability-inspire-action">
			<p><strong>Inspire Action (4 Intellect points):</strong> If one ally can see and easily understand you, you can instruct that ally to take an action.

		</li>
		<li id="ability-invisibility">
			<p><strong>Invisibility (4 Intellect points):</strong> You become invisible for ten minutes. While invisible, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position&mdash;attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to hide your position. If you have another ability that also confers invisibility, using either one allows you to remain invisible for twice as long as the duration specified.

		<li id="ability-jump-attack">
			<p><strong>Jump Attack (5+ Might points):</strong> You attempt a difficulty 4 Might roll to jump high into the air as part of your melee attack action. If you succeed at the jump and your attack hits, you inflict 3 additional points of damage and knock the foe prone. If you fail at the jump, you still make your normal attack roll, but you don't inflict the extra damage or knock down the opponent if you hit. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to enhance your jump; each level of Effort used in this way adds +2 feet to the height and +1 damage to the attack. Action. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-junkmonger">
			<p><strong>Junkmonger (2 Intellect points):</strong> You are trained in crafting two kinds of items using scavenged <a href="index.html#junk">junk</a>.

		<li id="ability-jury-rig">
			<p><strong>Jury-Rig (5 Intellect points):</strong> You quickly create an object using what would seem to be entirely inappropriate materials. You can make a bomb out of a tin can and household cleaners, a lockpick out of aluminum foil, or a sword out of broken furniture. The level of the item determines the difficulty of the task, but the appropriateness of the materials eases or hinders it as well. Generally, the object can be no larger than something you can hold in one hand, and it functions once (or, in the case of a weapon or similar item, is essentially useful for one encounter). If you spend at least ten minutes on the task, you can create an item of level 5 or lower. You can't change the nature of the materials involved. For example, you can't take iron rods and make a pile of gold coins or a wicker basket. Action. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span></p>

Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span><span class="og-ref">(RR, 121)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-knowing-the-unknown">
			<p><strong>Knowing the Unknown (6 Intellect points):</strong> By accessing the resources appropriate to your character, you can ask the GM one question and get a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. Action. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Knowledge of the Law:</strong> You're trained in the law of the land.

		</li>
		<li id="ability-lab-analysis">
			<p><strong>Lab Analysis (3 Intellect points):</strong> You analyze the scene of a crime, the site of a mysterious incident, or a series of unexplained phenomena, and maybe learn a surprising amount of information about the perpetrators, the participants, or the force(s) responsible. To do so, you must collect samples from the scene. Samples are paint or wood scrapings, dirt, photographs of the area, hair, an entire corpse, and so on. With samples in hand, you can discover up to three pertinent pieces of information about the scene, possibly clearing up a lesser mystery and pointing the way to solving a greater one. The GM will decide what you learn and what level of difficulty is needed to learn it. (For comparison, discovering that a victim was killed not by a fall, as seems immediately obvious, but rather by electrocution, is a difficulty 3 task for you.) The task is eased if you take the time to transport the samples to a permanent lab (if you have access to one), as opposed to conducting the analysis with your field science kit. Action to initiate, 2d20 minutes to complete. <span class="og-ref">(157)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-lead-by-inquiry">
			<p><strong>Lead by Inquiry:</strong> You keep your allies on their toes with occasional questions, jokes, and even mock drills for those who care to join in. After spending 24 hours with you, your allies are treated as if trained in tasks related to perception. This benefit is ongoing while you remain in your allies' company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to the allies' company within 24 hours. If you leave the allies' company for more than 24 hours, you must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(157)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-lethal-ploy">
			<p><strong>Lethal Ploy (5+ Intellect points):</strong> Long experience has revealed to you that subterfuge is your friend in desperate situations. You push, attack, or distract the target in some seemingly inconsequential way that leads to the target's death. The target must be level 2 or lower. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target by 1. Thus, to kill a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. Action. <span class="og-ref">(158)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-levity">
			<p><strong>Levity:</strong> Through wit, charm, humor, and grace, you are trained in all social interactions other than those involving coercion or intimidation.

For the next ten minutes, if anyone attempts to enter or pass through that area and you don't wish it, you make an automatic attack against them. If you hit, not only do you inflict damage, but they must also stop their movement. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(158)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-lost-in-the-chaos">
			<p><strong>Lost in the Chaos:</strong> When faced with several foes at once, you have developed tactics for using their numbers against them.

			<p><strong>Matter Cloud (5 Intellect points):</strong> Pebbles, dirt, sand, and debris rise into the air around you to form a swirling cloud. The cloud extends out to immediate range, moves with you, and lasts for one minute. When it ends, all the materials fall to the ground around you. The cloud makes it harder for other creatures to attack you, giving you an asset on Speed defense rolls. In addition, while the cloud is around you, you can use an action to whip the material so that it abrades everything within immediate range, dealing 1 point of damage to each creature and object in the area.

			<p><strong>Maximize Cypher:</strong> Choose one subtle cypher you bear. Its level becomes the maximum level possible for that cypher.

			<p class="og-ind">Your disembodied mind is a psychic construct that looks like you, though its frayed edges trail off into nothingness. You control this body as if it were your normal body and can act and move as you normally would with a few exceptions. You can move through solid objects as if you were phased, and you ignore any terrain feature that would impede your movement.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Your attacks inflict 3 fewer points of damage (to a minimum of 1) and you take 3 fewer points of damage (to a minimum of 1) from physical attacks, unless they can affect transdimensional or phased beings, in which case you take full damage.

			<p class="og-ind">Your physical body is helpless until this effect ends. You cannot use your physical senses to perceive anything. For example, your body could sustain a significant injury, and you wouldn't know it. Your body cannot take Intellect damage, so if your body takes enough damage to reduce both your Might Pool and your Speed Pool to 0, your mind snaps back to your body, and you are stunned until the end of the next round as you try to reorient yourself to your predicament.

			<p><strong>Minor Illusion (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create a single image of a creature or object within immediate range. The image must fit within a 10-foot (3 m) cube. The image can move (for example, you could make the illusion of a person walk or attack), but it can't leave the area defined by the cube. The illusion includes sound but not smell. It lasts for ten minutes, but if you want to change the original illusion significantly&mdash;such as making a creature appear to be wounded&mdash;you must concentrate on it again (though doing so doesn't cost additional Intellect points).

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the area (one level of Effort to fill a short area, two to fill a long area, or three to fill a very long area). Action. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 53)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-modify-artifact-power">
			<p><strong>Modify Artifact Power (6 Intellect points):</strong> You permanently add +1 to the level of an artifact of up to level 5. The difficulty of this task is equal to the modified higher level of the artifact. If the task is failed, the artifact makes a depletion roll and is not advanced in level.

		<li id="ability-modify-device">
			<p><strong>Modify Device (4 Intellect points):</strong> You jury-rig a piece of mechanical or electrical equipment to make it function above its rated specs for a very limited time. To do so, you must use spare parts equal to an expensive item, have a field science kit (or a permanent lab, if you have access to one), and succeed at a difficulty 3 Intellect-based task. When complete, using the device eases all tasks performed in conjunction with the device, until the device inevitably breaks. For example, you could overclock a computer so research tasks using it are easier, modify an espresso maker so that each cup of coffee made with it is better, modify a car's engine so that it goes faster (or modify its steering so it handles better), and so on.

		<li id="ability-necromancy">
			<p><strong>Necromancy (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You animate the body of a dead creature of approximately your size or smaller, creating a level 1 creature. It has none of the intelligence, memories, or special abilities that it had in life. The creature follows your verbal commands for one hour, after which it becomes an inert corpse. Unless the creature is killed by damage, you can reanimate it again when its time expires, but any damage it had when it became inert applies to its newly reanimated state. If you have access to multiple bodies, you can create an additional undead creature for each additional Intellect point you spend when you activate the ability. Action to animate. <span class="og-ref">(165)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Network Tap (4 Intellect points):</strong> You can ask the GM one question and get a very short answer if you succeed on an Intellect roll against a difficulty assigned by the GM.

			<ul class="og-list-disc">
				<li><em>Confusion.</em> Instead of making a normal attack, the nightmare's attack confuses the target for one round. On its next action, the target attacks an ally.</li>

				<li><em>Pustule Eruption.</em> Instead of making a normal attack, the nightmare's attack causes rancid, painful pustules to rise all over the target's skin for one minute.

			<p><strong>Not Dead Yet:</strong> When you would normally be dead, you instead fall unconscious for one round and then awaken.

However, unless it can figure out how to control its movement while being phased, which most creatures have no experience with, it begins to sink through solid matter. If it can't control itself or end the effect, it might be gone for good because when it becomes solid again after ten minutes, it's probably deep in the earth.

You can access this space as if it were a convenient pocket or bag, but nobody else can perceive or access the space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space can hold up to 1 cubic foot. The space is a part of you, so you can't use it to carry more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the space harms you, and so on.

			<p><strong>Projection (4 Intellect points):</strong> You project an image of yourself to any location you have seen or previously visited. Distance does not matter as long as the location is on the same world as you. The projection copies your appearance, movements, and any sounds you make for the next ten minutes.

			<p><strong>Psychic Burst (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You blast waves of mental force into the minds of up to three targets within short range (make an Intellect roll against each target).

			<p class="og-ind">You see, hear, smell, touch, and taste using the senses of the creature whose body you inhabit. When you speak, the words come from your defenseless body, and the creature you inhabit hears those words in their mind.</p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-psychokinetic-attack">
			<p><strong>Psychokinetic Attack (5 Intellect points):</strong> You can use this attack in one of two ways. The first is to pick up a heavy object and hurl it at someone within short range. This attack is an Intellect action, and if successful, it deals 6 points of damage to the target and to the hurled object (which could be another foe, although that would require two rolls&mdash;one roll to grab the first foe and another roll to hit the second foe with the first). The second way is to unleash a shattering burst of power that works only against an inanimate object no larger than half your size. Make an Intellect roll to instantly destroy the object; the task is eased by three steps compared to breaking it with brute strength. Action. <span class="og-ref">(172)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Push (2 Intellect points):</strong> You telekinetically push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you can't use this ability to pull a lever or close a door. Action. <span class="og-ref">(173)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Question Past Self (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You reach into the past up to a week and mentally ask your past self one or two questions about something you knew or observed at the chosen time. For example, if you've forgotten an important phone number or can't remember if a particular person was in a meeting, you can ask your past self about it while it's still fresh in your past self 's memory. Your past self doesn't perceive this as an intrusive voice&mdash;it just seems like an unexpected moment of reflection about the questions your present self asks. This doesn't allow you to remember things your past self didn't actually know at the time, but it can sometimes help your present self (in the form of an asset) learn more about or realize something your past self wasn't really paying attention to at the time (such as seeing part of a password or noting whether there was a red delivery truck nearby). For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can reach an additional week further into the past. Action. <span class="og-ref">(173)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-question-the-spirits">
			<p><strong>Question the Spirits (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can call a spirit to you and petition it to answer a few questions (usually no more than three before the spirit fades).</p>
			<p class="og-ind">First, you must summon a spirit. If it is a spirit of the dead, you must have personally known the creature, have an object that was owned by the creature, or touch the physical remains of the creature. For other spirits, you must know the spirit's full name or have a great deal of an element (such as fire or earth) that the spirit is associated with.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">If the spirit responds, it can manifest as an insubstantial shade that answers for itself, it can inhabit an object or any remains you provide, or it can manifest as an invisible presence that you speak for.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">The spirit may not wish to answer your questions, in which case you must persuade it to help. You can attempt to psychically wrestle the spirit into submission (an Intellect task), or you can try diplomacy, deception, or blackmail ("Answer me, or I'll tell your children that you were a philanderer" or "I'll destroy this relic that belonged to you").</p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-quick-strike">
			<p><strong>Quick Strike (4 Speed points):</strong> You make a melee attack with such speed that it is hard for your foe to defend against, and it knocks them off balance. Your attack is eased by two steps, and the foe, if struck, takes normal damage but is dazed so that their tasks are hindered for the next round. Action. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-quick-study">
			<p><strong>Quick Study:</strong> You learn from repetitive actions. You gain a +1 bonus to rolls for similar tasks after the first time (such as operating the same device or making attacks against the same foe).

		<li id="ability-quick-work">
			<p><strong>Quick Work (3+ Intellect points):</strong> One use of any artifact (or one minute of its continuous function) is increased by one level if you use it within the next minute.

		<li id="ability-rally-to-me">
			<p><strong>Rally to Me (2 Intellect points):</strong> You cry out, blow a battle horn, or otherwise signal to everyone within very long range that you require aid. All allied creatures who respond by moving to within an immediate distance of you within the next few rounds gain one asset on any one attack or defense task within the next hour that you suggest, such as "Hold the gate," "Charge that group of orcs," or something similar. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-range-increase">
			<p><strong>Range Increase:</strong> Ranges for you increase by one step. Immediate becomes short, short becomes long, long becomes very long, and very long becomes 1,000 feet (300 m). Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-ray-of-confusion">
			<p><strong>Ray of Confusion (2 Intellect points):</strong> You project a grey beam of confusion at a creature within short range, inflicting 1 point of damage that ignores Armor. In addition, until the end of the next round, all tasks, attacks, and defenses the target attempts are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-read-the-signs">
			<p><strong>Read the Signs (4 Intellect points):</strong> You examine an area and learn precise, useful details about the past (if any exist). You can ask the GM up to four questions about the immediate area; each requires its own roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-reading-decomposition">
			<p><strong>Reading Decomposition (3 Intellect points):</strong> You gain knowledge about an area by reading energy released by decomposition and decay. You can ask the GM a single, matter-of-fact question about the location and get an answer if you succeed on the Intellect roll. "What was the last ritual performed in this room?"" is a good example of a simple question. "Why was this room used for a ritual?" is not an appropriate question, because it has more to do with the mindset of whoever performed the ritual than with qualities of the room. Simple questions usually have a difficulty of 2, but technical questions or those that involve facts meant to be kept secret can have a much higher difficulty. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 60)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-reading-the-room">
			<p><strong>Reading the Room (3 Intellect points):</strong> You gain knowledge about an area by speaking with dead spirits or reading residual energies from the past. You can ask the GM a single, matter-of-fact question about the location and get an answer if you succeed on the Intellect roll. "What killed the cattle in this barn?" is a good example of a simple question. "Why were these cattle killed?" is not an appropriate question because it has more to do with the mindset of the killer than the barn. Simple questions usually have a difficulty of 2, but extremely technical questions or those that involve facts meant to be kept secret can have a much higher difficulty.

		</li>
		<li id="ability-recycled-cyphers">
			<p><strong>Recycled Cyphers:</strong> All manifest cyphers you use function at one level higher than normal. In addition, if given a week and at least ten items of junk from the <a href="index.html#junk">Junk</a> table, you can tinker with one of your manifest cyphers, transforming it into another cypher of the same type that you had in the past. The GM and player should collaborate to ensure that the transformation is logical&mdash; for example, you probably can't transform a pill into a helmet. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(175)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-regenerate">
			<p><strong>Regenerate:</strong> Your ability to heal (whether from a potent spell, unique mutation, or cybernetic graft) continues to function even if you die from violence, as long as your body is mostly intact. One minute after your death, this ability activates and brings you back to life; however, you come back with a permanent 2-point deduction from your Intellect Pool. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(175)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-regenerate-other">
			<p><strong>Regenerate Other (9 Might points):</strong> You can confer your Regenerate ability on another creature that you touch and attempt to return it to life, as long as its body is mostly intact. (If you don't have the Regenerate ability, you gain it, but can use it only on yourself.) The difficulty of the task is equal to 3 plus the number of days the target has been dead. (If the body has been perfectly preserved in stasis or through some other non-damaging preservation mechanism, no time limit applies.) Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(175)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-remote-viewing">
			<p><strong>Remote Viewing (6 Intellect points):</strong> Distance is an illusion, as all space is one space. With great concentration, you can see another place. This ability can be used in one of two ways:</p>
			<ul class="og-list-disc">
				<li>Distance and direction. Pick a spot a specific distance away and in a specific direction. You can see from that vantage point as if you had used the <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-sensor">Sensor</a> ability there, but only for one minute.</li>
				<li>Think of a place you have seen before, either conventionally or using the other application of this power. You can see from that vantage point as if you had used the Sensor ability there, but only for one or two rounds.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="og-ind">Either application takes anywhere from one action to hours of concentration, depending on what the GM feels is appropriate due to time, distance, or other mitigating circumstances. However, you don't know in advance how long it will take. Action to initiate; action each round to concentrate. <span class="og-ref">(176)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-repeated-rituals">
			<p><strong>Repeated Rituals:</strong> If you've successfully completed a ritual in the past, tasks for performing that ritual again are eased by two steps. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 54)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-repair-flesh">
			<p><strong>Repair Flesh (3 Intellect points):</strong> When you touch an impaired or debilitated character, you can move them up one step on <a href="index.html#the-damage-track">the damage track</a> (for example, a debilitated PC becomes impaired, and an impaired one becomes hale). Alternatively, if you use this ability on a PC during a rest, you grant them a +2 bonus to their <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>. Action. <span class="og-ref">(176)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-repair-machine">
			<p><strong>Repair Machine (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You automatically repair one broken device of up to level 4 that you touch, restoring it to full working condition. This ability works only if at least 80 percent of the original device is still on hand. The device may still need fuel, oil, or other substances that aid its operation but are not part of the electronics or mechanism. This ability only reliably works on human-crafted devices and tends to fail when used on alien, high-technology, or otherwise mysterious machines. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the target level that can be affected by 1. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 75)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-resist-the-elements">
			<p><strong>Resist the Elements:</strong> You resist heat, cold, and similar extremes. You have a special +2 to Armor against <a href="index.html#ambient-damage">ambient damage</a> or other damage that would normally ignore Armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(176)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-restore-life">
			<p><strong>Restore Life (9+ Intellect points):</strong> You can attempt to restore life to a dead creature of up to level 3, as long as the corpse is no more than a day old and is mostly intact. You can also attempt to restore life to a corpse that is much older but is especially well preserved. The difficulty of the Intellect task is equal to the level of the creature you're attempting to restore to life. For each additional level of Effort applied, you can attempt to restore the life of a creature whose level is 1 higher. When first restored to life, a creature is dazed for at least a day, and all tasks they attempt are hindered. Action; one minute to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(177)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-rewind-rot">
			<p><strong>Rewind Rot:</strong> Your grasp on life and death energy means that you can heal&mdash;even from death&mdash;as long as your head, heart, and hands remain intact. One minute after descending a step on the damage track, you regain 2 Pool points. However, if you return from death, it is with a permanent 2-point reduction in your Intellect Pool. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 60)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-ribbons-of-dark-matter">
			<p><strong>Ribbons of Dark Matter (2 Intellect points):</strong> For the next minute, dark matter condenses within an area within long range that is no bigger than an immediate distance in diameter, manifesting as swirling ribbons. All tasks attempted by creatures in the area are hindered, and leaving the area requires a creature's entire action to move. You can dismiss the dark matter early as an action. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(178)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-ritual-guidance">
			<p><strong>Ritual Guidance:</strong> When you participate in a magical ritual with two or more members of your coven, ritual tasks for all participants are eased by two steps. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 58)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-robot-assistant">
			<p><strong>Robot Assistant:</strong> A level 2 robot of your size or smaller (built by you) accompanies you and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work out the details of your robot. You'll probably make rolls for it when it takes actions. A robot assistant in combat usually doesn't make separate attacks but helps with yours. On your action, if the artificial assistant is next to you, it serves as an asset for one attack you make on your turn. If the robot is destroyed, you can repair the original with a few days' worth of tinkering, or build a new one with a week's worth of half-time labor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(178)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Safe Fall:</strong> You reduce the damage from a fall by 5 points. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(179)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-scan">
			<p><strong>Scan (2 Intellect points):</strong> You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and plastic. You might learn that the glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this ability doesn't tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don't know what the metal and plastic device does. In the second, you don't know if stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action. <span class="og-ref">(179)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-scramble-machine">
			<p><strong>Scramble Machine (2 Intellect points):</strong> You render one machine within short range unable to function for one round. Alternatively, you can hinder any action by the machine (or by someone attempting to use the machine) for one minute. Action. <span class="og-ref">(179)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-see-history">
			<p><strong>See History (4 Intellect points):</strong> You touch an object, read the subtle echoes of its existence through time, ask the GM a question about the object's past, and get a general answer. The answers are often in the form of brief images or sensations rather than specific answers in a language you know. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. After you use this ability, you have an asset on identifying the object. Action. <span class="og-ref">(180)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-see-the-unseen">
			<p><strong>See the Unseen:</strong> You can automatically perceive creatures and objects that are normally invisible, out of phase, or only partially in this universe. When looking for things more conventionally hidden, the task is eased. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(180)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-see-through-matter">
			<p><strong>See Through Matter (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You can see through matter as if it were transparent. You can see through up to 6 inches (15 cm) of material for one round. Doing so is a task whose difficulty is equal to the material or object's level. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to see through another 6 inches of material for each additional level of Effort you apply toward that goal. Action. <span class="og-ref">(180)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-see-through-time">
			<p><strong>See Through Time (7 Intellect points):</strong> Time is an illusion, as all time is one time. With great concentration, you can see into another time. You specify a time period regarding the place where you now stand. Interestingly, the easiest time to view is about one hundred years in the past or future. Viewing farther back or ahead is a nearly impossible task.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">This takes anywhere from one action to hours of concentration, depending on what the GM feels is appropriate due to time, distance, or other mitigating circumstances. However, you don't know in advance how long it will take. Action to initiate; action each round to concentrate. <span class="og-ref">(181)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-seize-the-initiative">
			<p><strong>Seize the Initiative (5 Intellect points):</strong> Within one minute of successfully using your <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-draw-conclusion">Draw Conclusion</a> ability, you can take one additional, immediate action, which you can take out of turn.

		</li>
		<li id="ability-seize-the-moment">
			<p><strong>Seize the Moment (4+ Speed points):</strong> If you succeed on a Speed defense roll to resist an attack, you gain an action. You can use the action immediately even if you have already taken a turn in the round.

The length of the shared memory can be no longer than about five minutes, but you can summarize longer memories (such as how you met, courted, and married your partner) with a "montage" that covers the most important details and underlying sentiment.

The object must be a small, mundane item composed of homogeneous matter (such as a clay cup, an iron ingot, a stone, and so on). The object explodes in an immediate radius, dealing 1 point of damage to all creatures and objects in the area.

If you applied Effort to inflict additional damage as part of the attack, each level of Effort inflicts only 2 additional points to all targets instead of 3 points. If you use Shield Burst with a melee attack, you and creatures behind you are not affected by this explosion.

Essentially, if the creature fails to defend against your presence, you control its actions for up to ten minutes. The target must be level 3 or lower. Once you have established control, you maintain control through verbal instruction. You can allow the target to act freely or override control on a case-by case basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to affect a level 5 target (two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two levels of Effort.

			<p><strong>Soothe the Savage (2 Intellect points):</strong> You calm a nonhuman beast within 30 feet (9 m). You must speak to it (although it doesn't need to understand your words), and it must see you. It remains calm for one minute or for as long as you focus all your attention on it. The GM has final say over what counts as a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of deception is at work, you should know whether you can affect a creature before you attempt to use this ability on it.

Your soul and their soul are interconnected (or the familiar might actually be a physical manifestation of your soul). The <a href="index.html#modern-magic-familiars">familiar</a> loves and cares for you like the best combination of a pet and a close friend.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">The familiar is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg); a typical soul familiar looks like a bird, cat, rat, lizard, snake, or toad, but more <a href="index.html#modern-magic-unusual-familiars">unusual forms</a> (such as a tiny demon, dragon, elemental, fey creature, or floating skull) are also possible. You and the GM must work out the details of your familiar, and you'll probably make rolls for them in combat or when they take actions. The familiar acts on your turn. Their movement is based on their creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on).</p>
			<p class="og-ind">You and your familiar can communicate telepathically within long range, or empathically within very long range. Beyond this range, you can only sense each other's general level of well-being.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Your familiar's presence within short range counts as an asset for magical tasks that require at least one minute to activate or maintain.</p>

While within this distance, your familiar also gains the benefit of any ongoing spell you cast on yourself (for example, if you cast a spell on yourself that lets you breathe water, your familiar can breathe water).</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Foes can use your soul familiar's connection to you against you. If a foe is holding or restraining your familiar (or touching it while it is held or restrained by another creature or a device, such as manacles or a cage), the foe's attacks and defenses against you are eased.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">If an attack against your familiar would reduce their health to 0, you can magically intervene so their health is instead reduced to 1 and you move one step down <a href="index.html#the-damage-track">the damage track</a>. If your familiar dies, you move one step down the damage track. If you die, your familiar instantly dies.

			<p><strong>Speaker for the Dead (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You can ask a question of a dead being whose corpse you are touching. Because the answer comes through the filter of the being's understanding and personality, it can't answer questions that it wouldn't have understood in life, and it can't provide answers that it wouldn't have known in life. In fact, the being is not compelled to answer at all, so you might need to interact with it in a way that would have convinced it to answer while it was alive. For each additional Intellect point you spend when you activate the ability, you can ask the being an additional question. Action. <span class="og-ref">(184)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Spectral Servant (2 Intellect points):</strong> You conjure a spectral servant, a semi-real magical construct that resembles the vague nonthreatening outline of a person. It is more of an extension of your will than a separate being, and it automatically assists you in simple tasks like bringing drinks to houseguests and dealing with chores. It cannot attack or defend, and it vanishes if you are ever more than a short distance from it. The servant lasts for one hour before disappearing. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 72)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Spin Attack (5+ Speed points):</strong> You stand still and make attacks against up to five foes, all as part of the same action in one round. All of the attacks have to be the same sort of attack (melee or ranged). Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to all of these attacks.

		<li id="ability-spore-cloud">
			<p><strong>Spore Cloud (1 Intellect point):</strong> You throw a handful of mushrooms that speed toward a target within long range. The attack inflicts 3 points of damage and envelops the target in a haze of toxic spores, which inflicts 1 additional point of damage per round (ignores Armor) for the next minute or until the target uses an action to wash the spores away.

			<p><strong>Spray (2 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow or submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. This ability uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). You are trained in making this attack. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal.

			<p><strong>Stun Attack (6 Speed points):</strong> You attempt a difficulty 5 Speed task to <a href="index.html#special-damage">stun</a> a creature as part of your melee or ranged attack. If you succeed, your attack inflicts its normal damage and stuns the creature for one round, causing it to lose its next turn. If you fail, you still make your normal attack roll, but you don't stun the opponent if you hit. If you also have this ability from another source (such as having it as a type ability and a focus ability), using this costs you only 3 points instead of 6 points.

			<p><strong>Subsonic Rumble (2 Intellect points):</strong> For one minute or until you use some other sound manipulation ability, you emit a subsonic rumble that most living creatures can't hear but which has an effect on them all the same. The effect lasts for one minute and affects all creatures you select within short range. All tasks related to resisting persuasion, intimidation, and fear are hindered by two steps for affected targets. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(187)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Subtle Tricks:</strong> You can use your skills and special abilities in ways that don't look like you're doing anything. If the skill or ability would normally require an obvious movement, phrase, or other action by you, it instead seems to happen on its own. Instead of using your tools to pick a lock, the lock clicks open as you stand near it. Instead of manipulating a computer screen, the information you want appears on the screen when you look at it. Instead of bluffing your way past some guards, they step aside as you approach and let you through. This ability usually only works up to an immediate distance. You still must spend points and make rolls to use your skills and abilities with Subtle Tricks. Using a skill or ability in a subtle way hinders the task.

			<p><strong>Suggestion (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You suggest an action to a creature within immediate range. If the action is something that the target might normally do anyway, it follows your suggestion. If the suggestion is something that is outside of the target's nature or express duty (such as asking a guard to let an intruder pass), the suggestion fails. The creature must be level 2 or lower. The effect of your suggestion lasts for up to a minute.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target you can affect by 1. Thus, to affect a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort.</p>

		<li id="ability-storm-seed">
			<p><strong>Storm Seed (3 Intellect points):</strong> If outside or in a large-enough enclosed space, you can seed a natural storm of a kind common to the area. Doing so requires at least an hour's concentration as you use your connection to the air (whether this is due to nanobots, elemental spirits, magic, or some other source) to initiate proper conditions, though it could take longer if the GM feels there are additional obstacles at play. Once the storm begins, it lasts for about ten minutes. Once during that period, you can create a more dramatic and specific effect appropriate to that kind of storm, such as a lightning strike, a squall of giant hailstones, the brief touchdown of a twister, a single gust of hurricane-force winds, and so on. These effects must occur within long range of your location. You must spend your turn concentrating to create the effect, which occurs a round later. The effect inflicts 6 points of damage, after which the storm begins to disperse. Action to initiate, an hour or more to complete. <span class="og-ref">(187)</span></p>

		<li id="ability-take-command">
			<p><strong>Take Command (3 Intellect points):</strong> You issue a specific command to another character. If that character chooses to listen, any attack they attempt on their next turn is eased, and a hit deals 3 additional points of damage. If your command is to perform a task other than an attack, the task is eased as if it benefited from a <a href="index.html#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a>. Action. <span class="og-ref">(188)</span></p>

If you concentrate and don't move from where you're standing for one minute, you restore 3 points to your Might or Speed Pool. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you've made a ten-hour recovery roll.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">If you have the <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-store-energy">Store Energy</a> ability, you can instead use Tap Currents to add 3 points to your Siphon Pool. (This use of this ability is not limited to one use per ten-hour recovery roll.)</p>

Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge  of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable adult human), and you can use it to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m). This power lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it's not a means of attack. You can't use this ability on your own body.

Communication is two-way, but the other party must be willing and able to communicate. You don't have to see the target, but you must know that it's within range. You can have more than one active contact at once, but you must establish contact with each target individually. Each contact lasts up to ten minutes.

			<p><strong>Telepathic Network (0+ Intellect points):</strong> When you wish it, you can contact up to ten creatures known to you, no matter where they are. All targets must be willing and able to communicate. You automatically succeed at establishing a telepathic network; no roll is required. All creatures in the network are linked and can communicate telepathically with one another. They can also "overhear" anything said in the network, if they wish. Activating this ability doesn't require an action and doesn't cost Intellect points; to you, it's as easy as speaking out loud. The network lasts until you choose to end it. If you spend 5 Intellect points, you can contact twenty creatures at once, and for every 1 Intellect point you spend above that, you can add ten more creatures to the network. These larger networks last for ten minutes. Creating a network of twenty or more creatures does require an action to establish contact. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-terrifying-gaze">
			<p><strong>Terrifying Gaze (6 Intellect points):</strong> You project a chilling gaze at all living creatures within short range who can see you. Make a separate Intellect attack roll for each target. Success means that the creature is frozen in fear, not moving or taking actions for one minute or until it is attacked. Some creatures without minds (such as robots) might be immune to Terrifying Gaze. Action. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-terrifying-image">
			<p><strong>Terrifying Image (6 Intellect points):</strong> You use a bit of subtle telepathy to learn which images would appear terrifying to creatures that you choose within long range. Those images appear within that area and menace the appropriate creatures. Make an Intellect attack roll against each creature you want to affect. Success means the creature flees in terror for one minute, pursued by its nightmares. Failure means the creature ignores the images, which do not hamper it in any way. Action. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-terrifying-presence">
			<p><strong>Terrifying Presence (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You convince one intelligent target of level 3 or lower that you are its worst nightmare. The target must be within short range and be able to understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can't even move), the target is paralyzed with fear, runs away, or takes some other action appropriate to the circumstances. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to terrorize a level 5 target (two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two levels of Effort. Action. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-theres-your-problem">
			<p><strong>There's Your Problem:</strong> You are trained in tasks related to figuring out how to solve problems with multiple solutions (like the best way to pack a truck, calm an enraged customer, give a cat a shot of insulin, or find a route through the city for maximum speed). Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-third-eye">
			<p><strong>Third Eye (1 Intellect point):</strong> You visualize a place within short range and cast your mind to that place, creating an immobile, invisible sensor for one minute or until you choose to end this ability. While using your third eye, you see through your sensor instead of your eyes using your normal visual abilities. You may perceive the area around your body using your other senses as normal. Action. <span class="og-ref">(191)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-total-awareness">
			<p><strong>Total Awareness:</strong> You possess such a high level of awareness that it's very difficult to surprise, hide from, or sneak up on you. When you apply a level of Effort to initiative and perception tasks, you gain two free levels of Effort. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(192)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-totally-chill">
			<p><strong>Totally Chill:</strong> Your ten-minute <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a> takes you only one round. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(192)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-tough-as-nails">
			<p><strong>Tough As Nails:</strong> When you are impaired or debilitated on <a href="index.html#the-damage-track">the damage track</a>, Might-based tasks and defense rolls you attempt are eased. If you also have <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-ignore-the-pain">Ignore the Pain</a>, make a difficulty 1 Might defense roll when you reach 0 points in all three of your Pools to immediately regain 1 Might point and avoid dying. Each time you attempt to save yourself with this ability before your next ten-hour <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>, the task is hindered. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(192)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-tough-it-out">
			<p><strong>Tough It Out:</strong> Working for a living has toughened you over time. You have +1 to Armor against any kind of physical damage, even damage that normally ignores Armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-tower-of-intellect">
			<p><strong>Tower of Intellect:</strong> You are trained in Intellect defense tasks. If you are already trained, you are specialized in those tasks instead. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-tower-of-will">
			<p><strong>Tower of Will:</strong> You are trained in Intellect defense tasks and gain +3 points to your Intellect Pool. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-trained-gunner">
			<p><strong>Trained Gunner:</strong> You can choose from one of two benefits. Either you are trained in using guns, or you have the <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-spray">Spray</a> ability (which costs 2 Speed points): If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as an automatic pistol), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. This move uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). The attack roll is eased. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal. Enabler (being trained in using guns) or action (Spray). <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-trained-without-armor">
			<p><strong>Trained Without Armor:</strong> You are trained in Speed defense tasks when not wearing armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-trapster">
			<p><strong>Trapster:</strong> You are trained in creating simple traps for human-sized or smaller targets, especially many varieties of deadfalls and snares using natural objects from the surrounding environment. When you lay a trap, decide whether you want to hold the victim in place (a snare) or inflict damage (a deadfall). Creating a snare is a difficulty 3 task, while the difficulty of creating a deadfall is equal to the number of points of damage you want it to inflict. For example, if you want to inflict 4 points of damage, that's a difficulty 4 task (the training that comes with this ability eases the task).</p>
			<p class="og-ind">On a success, you create your one-use trap in about one minute, and it is considered level 3 for the purposes of avoiding detection before it is sprung and for a victim trying to struggle free (if a snare). Action to initiate, one minute or one hour to complete. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-traverse-the-worlds">
			<p><strong>Traverse the Worlds (8+ Intellect points):</strong> You instantaneously transmit yourself to another planet, dimension, plane, or level of reality. You must know that the destination exists; the GM will decide if you have enough information to confirm its existence and the level of difficulty to reach the destination. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. You must touch any additional targets. Action. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-trick-shot">
			<p><strong>Trick Shot (2 Speed points):</strong> As part of the same action, you make a ranged attack against two targets that are within immediate range of each other. Make a separate attack roll against each target. The attack rolls are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-true-necromancy">
			<p><strong>True Necromancy (8+ Intellect points):</strong> This ability works like the <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-necromancy">Necromancy</a> ability except that it creates a level 5 creature. Action to animate. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-trust-to-luck">
			<p><strong>Trust to Luck (3 Intellect points):</strong> Sometimes, you've just got to roll the dice and hope things add up in your favor. When you use Trust to Luck, roll a d6. On any even result, the task you're attempting is eased by two steps. On a roll of 1, the task is hindered. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-twisting-the-knife">
			<p><strong>Twisting the Knife (4 Speed points):</strong> In a round after successfully striking a foe with a melee weapon, you can opt to automatically deal standard damage to the foe with that same weapon without any modifiers (2 points for a light weapon, 4 points for a medium weapon, or 6 points for a heavy weapon). Action. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-ultra-enhancement">
			<p><strong>Ultra Enhancement:</strong> You gain +1 to Armor and +5 to each of your three stat Pools. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-unarmed-fighting-style">
			<p><strong>Unarmed Fighting Style:</strong> You are trained in unarmed attacks. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-underworld-contacts">
			<p><strong>Underworld Contacts:</strong> You know many people in a variety of communities who engage in illegal activities. These people are not necessarily your friends and might not be trustworthy, but they recognize you as a peer. You and the GM should work out the details of your underworld contacts. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(195)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-unmovable">
			<p><strong>Unmovable (3 Might points):</strong> You avoid being knocked down, pushed back, or moved against your will as long as you are upright and able to take actions. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(195)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-unraveling-consumption">
			<p><strong>Unraveling Consumption:</strong> You can drain energy from a living creature by touching it and concentrating for a minute or more. Each minute you spend in contact with and concentrating on the creature deals it 1 point of damage (ignores Armor) and restores 1 point to your Might or Speed Pool. Because of the extended contact required for this ability, normally you can use it only on a willing or helpless creature. If the creature takes enough damage to knock it unconscious or kill it, it crumbles into ash, dust, or some other inert material. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(195)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-unstealable-charm">
			<p><strong>Unstealable Charm (3+ Intellect points):</strong> An object you are holding, touching, or wearing becomes more difficult to steal; attempts to remove it from your person without your knowledge or permission are hindered. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can apply Effort to hinder such attempts by an additional step. The charm lasts for twenty-four hours. Action.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-use-senses-of-others">
			<p><strong>Use Senses of Others (4 Intellect points):</strong> You can see, hear, smell, touch, and taste through the senses of anyone with whom you have telepathic contact by using <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-telepathic">Telepathic</a> or similar abilities. You can attempt to use this ability on a willing or unwilling target within long range; an unwilling target can try to resist. You don't need to see the target, but you must know that it's within range. Your shared senses last ten minutes. Action to establish. <span class="og-ref">(195)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-using-the-environment">
			<p><strong>Using the Environment (4 Intellect points):</strong> You find some way to use the environment to your advantage in a fight. For the next ten minutes, attack rolls and Speed defense rolls are eased. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(195)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-using-whats-available">
			<p><strong>Using What's Available (4 Intellect points):</strong> If you have the time and the freedom to scrounge for everyday materials in your environment, you can fashion a temporary asset that will aid you once to accomplish a specific task. For example, if you need to climb a wall, you could create some sort of climbing assistance device; if you need to break out of a cell, you can find something to use as a lockpick; if you need to create a small distraction, you could put together something to make a loud bang and flash; and so on. The asset lasts for a maximum of one minute, or until used for the intended purpose. One minute to assemble materials; action to create asset. <span class="og-ref">(195)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-usurp-cypher">
			<p><strong>Usurp Cypher:</strong> Choose one cypher that you carry. The cypher must have an effect that is not instantaneous. You destroy the cypher and gain its power, which functions for you continuously. You can choose a cypher when you gain this ability, or you can wait and make the choice later. However, once you usurp a cypher's power, you cannot later switch to a different cypher&mdash;the usurping ability works only once. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(195)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-vanish">
			<p><strong>Vanish (2 Intellect points):</strong> You become invisible for a short amount of time. While invisible, you have an asset on stealth and Speed defense tasks. The invisibility ends at the end of your next turn, or if you do something to reveal your presence or position&mdash;attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. Action. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-versatile-mind">
			<p><strong>Versatile Mind:</strong> When you make a Speed defense roll, you can use your Intellect in place of your Speed. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-void-wings">
			<p><strong>Void Wings (3 Intellect points):</strong> Swirling ribbons of weird matter grasp you and lift you up, allowing you to fly for one round as quickly as you can move. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-ward">
			<p><strong>Ward:</strong> You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p>

			<p><strong>Weapon Master:</strong> You inflict an additional 1 point of damage with your chosen weapon. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(197)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-weaponization">
			<p><strong>Weaponization:</strong> One light or medium melee weapon of your choice is built into your body, and you are trained in using it. The weapon is concealed until you wish to use it. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(197)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-weather-the-vicissitudes">
			<p><strong>Weather the Vicissitudes:</strong> Helping your friends means being able to stand up to everything the world throws at you. You have +1 to Armor. Also, you resist heat, cold, and similar extremes and have an additional +1 to Armor against <a href="index.html#ambient-damage">ambient damage</a> or other damage that would normally ignore Armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(197)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-weight-of-the-world">
			<p><strong>Weight of the World (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You can increase a target's weight dramatically. The target is pulled to the ground and can't move physically under its own power for one minute. The target must be within short range. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect additional creatures (one per level of Effort). Action. <span class="og-ref">(197)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-weightless-shot">
			<p><strong>Weightless Shot:</strong> You have a sixth sense when it comes to lining up trajectories and moving in low-gravity and zero-gravity environments, which also translates to making ranged attacks. When you hit a target with a ranged attack in microgravity conditions, you can choose to reduce the damage by 2 points but hit the target in a precise spot. Some of the possible effects include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
			<ul class="og-list-disc">
				<li>You punch a hole in the target's suit, so it begins to leak air into the vacuum slowly, or all at once (your choice).</li>
				<li>You hit the reaction mass of the target's maneuvering pack, which means the target can no longer change their trajectory, or they go spinning off in a random direction (your choice).</li>
				<li>You can shoot a spacecraft, and degrade one ship system by one step (systems include engines, weapons, and atmosphere).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="og-ind">Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(197)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-weighty">
			<p><strong>Weighty (1 Intellect point):</strong> You briefly increase the weight of a target within short range enough to stop them in their tracks, preventing the target from moving and hindering any attempted tasks on their next turn. Action. <span class="og-ref">(197)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-wilderness-awareness">
			<p><strong>Wilderness Awareness (4 Intellect points):</strong> Your connection to the natural world extends to a degree that some would call supernatural. While in the wilderness, you can extend your senses up to a mile in any direction and ask the GM a very simple, general question about that area, such as "Where is the orc camp?" or "Is my friend Deithan still alive?" If the answer you seek is not in the area, you receive no information. Action. <span class="og-ref">(198)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-wilderness-life">
			<p><strong>Wilderness Life:</strong> You are trained in two of the following: climbing, swimming, navigation, or identifying plants and creatures. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(199)</span></p>

		</li>
		<li id="ability-willing-sacrifice">
			<p><strong>Willing Sacrifice:</strong> When you take an attack meant for another character, you know how to <a href="index.html#cooperative-actions">take the attack</a> in a way that minimizes its effect. The attack automatically strikes you, but instead of taking 1 additional point of damage, you take 1 less point of damage (to a minimum of 1 point). Additionally, you can take more than one attack in a given round provided that all the attacks were originally meant for one target. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(199)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-wind-armor">
			<p><strong>Wind Armor (1 Intellect point):</strong> When you wish it, a cyclone of wind surrounds your body for ten minutes, giving you +1 to Armor and an additional +2 to Armor against physical projectile weapons specifically. While the cyclone is active, you feel no discomfort from the wind, and you can interact with other creatures and objects normally because the wind flow automatically diverts to enable such interaction. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(199)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-wind-chariot">
			<p><strong>Wind Chariot (7+ Intellect points):</strong> You summon winds that pick you up and allow you to fly for up to a long distance each round in combat or with an overland speed of up to 200 miles per hour (320 kph) for up to ten hours. For each level of Effort you apply, you can bring one ally of about your size with you through the air or increase the duration of the effect by one hour. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(199)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-windrider">
			<p><strong>Windrider (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You summon winds that pick you up and allow you to fly for one minute at a rate of up to a long distance each round. For each level of Effort you apply, you can carry one ally of about your size with you through the air or increase the duration of the effect by one minute. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(199)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-word-of-death">
			<p><strong>Word of Death (5+ Intellect points):</strong> Your attack is the utterance of a magic word so terrible that it snuffs the life from a living target within short range. The target must be level 1. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to kill a level 5 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort. Action. <span class="og-ref">(200)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-work-the-friendship">
			<p><strong>Work the Friendship (4 Intellect points):</strong> You know just what to say to draw a little extra effort from an ally. This grants one creature you choose within short range an additional, immediate action, which it can take out of turn. The creature uses the additional action however it wishes. Action. <span class="og-ref">(200)</span></p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-wreck">
			<p><strong>Wreck:</strong> Using two hands, you wield a weapon or a tool with a powerful swing. (If fighting unarmed, this attack is made with both fists or both feet together.) When using this as an attack, you take a &minus;1 penalty to the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of damage. When attempting to damage an object or barrier, you are trained in the task. Action. <span class="og-ref">(200)</span></p>

			<p>When using this rule, the GM provides a prepared list or table of <a href="index.html#skills">skills</a> for the game. The GM also decides how many skills PCs begin with. The specifics depend on the examples, which are explored in the two examples that follow. But for now, the GM should consider the following qualities that make for a great skill system:</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Skills should be associated with meaningful tasks PCs will perform in the genre and setting.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Organization and Presentation:</strong> Different settings and genres will require different categories and groups of skills.</p></li>

				<p>The GM might approve a PC take <a href="index.html#key-concepts">inabilities</a>, which are determined by choosing from a GM-provided list, rolling on a GM-provided skills table, or choosing an inability with certain types of weapons. A PC must take an inability with heavy weapons before taking an inability with medium weapons. The PC chooses or rolls one additional skill for each inability they take. If any result would grant a PC an inability in a skill they are already trained in, make a new roll on the table. The GM determines how many inabilities a PC can take. It's probably a good idea for this number not to exceed three.</p>

		<p>Gritty advancement means a character directs their character growth each advancement, but it's probably more costly to increase certain aspects of the character than others&mdash;especially those things a PC increased in the past. The GM should take care to ensure plenty of opportunities for PCs to gain a character advancement&mdash;at least once each session is a good baseline. This system assumes characters will advance differently and at different rates.</p>
		<p class="og-ind">These rules assume that character advancements are purchased with 4 XP, but the GM might decide character advancements are earned by other means, for example, completing quests.</p>

	<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
		<li><p><strong>Personal Vow:</strong> A vow works similar to a <a href="index.html#character-arcs">Character Arc</a>. The GM and player should ensure that a personal vow is something that can be addressed in the course of the game's scope and length. A character earns 1 XP whenever they progress toward a resolution of their personal vow.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Shared Vow:</strong> Each PC can share an ally's Vow. When two PCs share a vow, any XP earned toward completing that vow is shared between all who have sworn that vow.</p></li>

	<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
		<p><strong>Sharing an NPC's Vow:</strong> PCs might find themselves in the position to be available to share a vow with an NPC, creature or other entity. These absences can be a good source of new stories, GM intrusion, or overdue closure that have come up in stories.</p>

	<p>Circumstances might one day dictate that the situation throws two PCs' vows into conflict. If a vow is broken, for example, through a betrayal of principle, an unexpected defense of the opposition, a creature's loss of freedom or their life.</p>
	<p class="og-ind">Vows allow players to push one eachother's PCs to their emotional limits, and rely on players being able to trust one another to direct the narrative on their own. Some vows might bring PCs to the bring of crossing lines they did not think they could cross.

		<p>Vows will work differently in a game depending on the genre, the world, and the specifics of the a broken or abandoned vow, but resuming an abandoned vow usually requires at least 1 day, and costs 1 XP.</p>
		<p class="og-ind"><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> If the GM determines PCs are playing fast and loose with their vows&mdash;someting that can be a valid playchoice!&mdash;a broken vow serves as a great source of GM intrusion. Unforeseen circumstances, a case of mistaken identity, or a simple mistake that tips off the wrong people might cause a PC to break a vow. A broken vow is a good source of <a href="index.html#choose-gm-intrusion-basic">GM intrusion</a>.</p>

		<li><p><strong>Heroic subtle cyphers</strong> mimic commonly used plot devices in stories. Heroic subtle cyphers often allow success without the need for a roll, and can allow a PC to step outside their usual role and perform an unexpected feat. They are especially useful for games and settings with a sense of melodrama, from slasher horror to gritty modern spy thrillers, and romantic comedies to high-octane post-apocalyptic action and wacky space operas.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Incidental subtle cyphers</strong> function similar to <a href="index.html#running-the-game-player-intrusions">player intrusions</a>, in that they can cause objects, creatures, or events to appear, as if by a stroke of luck. Because of this, a GM might occasionally refuse their use to maintain the verisimilitude  of the game. In such instances, an incidental subtle cypher is not expended. The GM might also delay the onset of an incidental subtle cypher's effects for some amount of time until it is more appropriate to the scene.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Supplemental cyphers</strong> might be best suited for games with fantastic elements. The GM decides if these cyphers are manifest or subtle.</p></li>

		<p class="og-ind">Heroic subtle cyphers and incidental subtle cyphers can be a good way to encourage players to use cyphers, spend XP, develop roleplay, and come up with ideas for various kinds of player intrusions.

			<p>A phobia is an overwhelming fear with an exaggerated and often unrealistic sense of danger about an object, situation, or activity.

	<p>It's important for the GM to decide how much of the game will take place piloting mechs, and how much will involve experiences outside of the cockpit. Like any setting, the GM should be thoughtful about how PCs are constructed, for example:</p>
	<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
		<li><p><strong>Gritty:</strong> Compared to mechs, pilots are fragile and limited. Use the PC generation method outlined in <a href="#chapter-8-gritty-rules-modules">Chapter 8: Gritty Rules Modules</a>.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Mundane Pilots:</strong> Use the standard Cypher System <a href="index.html#character-sentence-generator">character creation</a>, but PCs can only choose from <a href="index.html#mundane-foci">mundane foci</a>. Some abilities and skills will not be applicable when piloting mechs (determined by the GM).</p></li>

Players might combine their <a href="index.html#choose-descriptor">descriptor</a>, <a href="index.html#choose-type">type</a>, <a href="index.html#choose-focus">focus</a> with their <a href="#mech-properties">mech focus</a>.</p></li>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<p>In many ways, operating a mechs is like having a bigger and stronger PC, but there are a few differences:</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Entering and Exiting:</strong> Entering or exiting a mech and becoming ready to pilot it requires an action, at minimum&mdash;The GM might decide start-up for mechs requires a longer procedure.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Movement:</strong> Mechs can move a long distance each round as an action. If the pilot succeeds on a difficulty 4 Speed task, the mech can move a long distance and take another relatively simple action (for example, moving again or making an attack). What is considered difficult terrain for a mech might depend on its <a href="#mech-magnitude">magnitude</a>.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Mech Abilities:</strong> Like PCs, mechs have a <a href="index.html#choose-focus">focus</a>. While operating a mech, a pilot can use their own abilities, or activate any of the mech's focus abilities available to the pilot's tier. The GM might decide certain PC abilities can't be used by while piloting.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tech Points:</strong> Mechs have a single Pool of <a href="mech-tech-points">Tech points</a>, whose maximum equals the pilot's total Pool points + 8. Like a PC's stat Pools, a mech's Tech points measure their remaining offensive output, defensive capacity, and structural condition.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tech Modules:</strong> Mechs with <a href="#mech-tech-modules">tech modules</a> have been upgraded or customized.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Magnitude:</strong> <a href="#mech-magnitude">Magnitude</a> measures a mech's overall threat level independent of pilot skill. Depending on the setting, it might represent size, technology level, or a combination of the two.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
					<li><p><strong>Piloting Skill:</strong> The default assumption is that mech pilots PCs are skilled with the basic operation of a mech. The GM could treat "piloting" skill to be broadly applicable to a wide variety of movement tasks, but require more specific training related to other tasks. Additionally, the GM might hinder tasks when piloting an unfamiliar mech.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Co-Piloting:</strong> In some settings, mechs might require more than one pilot, and use the <a href="index.html">Bridge Combat</a> <span class="og-ref">(SF, 43)</span> or <a href="#mech-combined">Drift Piloting</a> rules for their operation.</p></li>

				<p>The GM should consider the following questions about how they want mechs to work in the setting and feel in gameplay:</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
					<li><p><strong>Cosmetics and Thematics:</strong> Cosmetic limitations or thematic requirements for mechs might be in order. For example, it might be important to the setting that each mech is modeled after an animal shape, or has a more-or-less humanoid frame.</p>
					<li><p><strong>Mission Profile:</strong> What are the mechs for? Do they defend a particular location, or are they regularly deployed to different locations? Is mech warfare conducted by engaging in an all-out assault, or do they involve long-term missions behind enemy lines?</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Choosing Mech Foci:</strong> The GM determines what <a href="index.html#choose-focus">foci</a> are available to PCs and their mechs as appropriate for the setting&mdash;mechs might be mundane creations of science and steel, while others might be made of enchanted ironwood and fueled by magic crystals. Select foci that highlight what the mech does, not the pilot. For example, a pilot who <a href="index.html#focus-infiltrates">Infiltrates</a> might pilot a mech that <a href="index.html#focus-crafts-illusions">Crafts Illusions</a>.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Mech Foci and Pilot Skill:</strong> Pilot and mech skills can sum together where appropriate. For example, if a PC is trained with medium weapons, and the mech gains <a class="og-ability" href="#ability-skill-with-attacks">Skill With Attacks</a>, the player could choose a medium weapon that causes the mech's attacks to become specialized with.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Customizing Pilots and Mechs:</strong> Make use of the <a href="index.html#choose-flavor">flavor</a> options, and exchange abilities from a type or focus for something more interesting from <a href="index.html#chapter-9-abilities">Chapter 9: Abilities</a>. In some settings, pilots might maintain more than one mech, and choose which one to use on a mission.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Cyphers and Artifacts:</strong> The GM determines if <a href="index.html#choose-cyphers">cyphers</a> and <a href="index.html#choose-artifacts">artifacts</a> apply to pilots, mechs, or both.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Crafting, Building and Repairing Mechs:</strong> Depending on the setting, PCs might want to <a href="index.html#crafting-building-and-repairing">craft, build, or repair</a> mechs&mdash;at least to an operable status. Full repairs might require the a workshop or other appropriate facility.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Optional Rules:</strong> The GM might allow mech pilots to perform <a href="index.html#extended-vehicular-combat-redline-maneuver">redline maneuvers</a> <span class="og-ref">(SF, 41)</span> or use the optional <a href="index.html#house-rule-ultimate-damage">Ultimate Damage</a> <span class="og-ref">(OG-CSRD)</span> rule.</p></li>

					<li><p><strong>Repair:</strong> As part of another action, the mech can regain 1d6 + pilot tier missing Tech points. You can choose this module up to three times.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Shielding:</strong> You gain +3 Shielding points. You can choose to use Shielding points to reduce damage inflicted&mdash;even <a href="index.html">ambient damage</a> or other damage that usually ignores the mech's Armor (no action required).

		<h5 class="og-h-small" id="mech-combined">Optional Rule: Combined Mechs<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#mech-combined" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
		<p>Resolving the effects of the <a href="#mech-tech-fantastic">combiner module</a> requires the GM to make a few additional decisions about how piloting combined mechs work. These options are also good to think about in any co-piloting situation.</p>
		<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
			<li><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> The GM determines if any two or more mechs with a combiner module are compatible, or if combine mechs must be manufactured to be compatible in combination.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Bridge Combat:</strong> The combined mech has multiple stations, and is operated using the rules for <a href="index.html">Bridge Combat</a> <span class="og-ref">(SF, 43)</span></p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Drift Piloting:</strong> Alternatively, combined mechs require coordinated piloting. If co-pilots work together on an action, the action is eased by two steps. If each pilot takes their own action, their tasks are hindered.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Combine Abilities:</strong> The GM decides if combined mechs retain any of the component mechs' focus abilities, and if the combined mech gains its own focus or additional abilities and tech modules. The GM also decides which stations activate the combined mech's abilities, and might require a station have a minimum number of pilots. Each missing pilot at a station hinders tasks performed at that station one step.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Combine Tech Pools:</strong> Depending on the setting, the GM might prefer to keep a combined mech's Tech points in a single number. Start with the mech with the highest number of tech points, and add +8 for each component mech. This is an easier solution, especially if there are four or more component mechs to combine.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Component Mechs:</strong> Alternatively, the GM might decide component mechs retain their own Tech points, and each component mech can be targeted independently. When using this solution, it's probably best if there are only two or three component mechs.</p></li>
