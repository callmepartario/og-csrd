			<p>This should go without saying, but Old Gus' Unofficial Cypher System Player's Guide (OG-CSPG) does not contain the official Cypher System rules. These rules have been rearranged, rewritten, and condensed so that you can learn to play the game quickly and easily. It also guides you through creating and customizing your player character (PC) before the game, or as you continue playing with the GM.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">This edition of the rules allows you to do this with the bare minimum of page-turning involved other than to reference the table of contents.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">If you are a GM, it's best to familiarize yourself with the official rules of the game in the <a class="og-icon og-mcg" href="https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/">Cypher System Rulebook</a> or <a href="index.html">Old Gus' Cypher System Reference Document (OG-CSRD)</a>. GMs might still find some unique perspective within&mdash;or use for&mdash;this version of the rules, for example, as a teaching tool for players.</p>
			<p class="og-ind"><strong>Players or GMs can supplement character sheets or packets by printing excerpts</strong>&mdash;descriptors, abilities and foci, and flavors are largely unedited, with the full text of their special abilities included inline. The presentation of types has been slightly amended for clarity during character creation.</p>
			<p class="og-ind"><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong> I hope this document is useful to you, and brings you many happy adventures in the Cypher System.

			<p>An encounter might be any number of things&mdash;a fight with a foe, a dramatic crossing of a raging river, or a stressful negotiation with an important official. An encounter is made up of one or more rounds.</p>
			<div class="alert pb-0">
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
					<li><p><strong>Initiative:</strong> When many characters&mdash;including NPCs&mdash;want to take an action all at once, the GM calls for an initiative roll to determine who goes first. An initiative roll is a <a href="#speed">Speed</a> task.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Round:</strong> A round lasts five to ten seconds. The length of time is variable&mdash;one round might be a bit longer than the next. On average, there are about ten rounds in a minute. Each round, you&mdash;and each other character&mdash;get a turn.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> On your turn, you get to choose what <a href="#action">action</a> you take.

				<p>A player intrusion is a special kind of immediate benefit&mdash;the reverse of a <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a>: instead of the GM giving you XP and introducing an unexpected complication, you spend 1 XP and present a solution to a problem or complication.

					<li><p><strong>General Cypher:</strong> You ask the GM for a general subtle cypher, such as healing, movement, defense, or something specific, like flight.

					<li><p><strong>Specific Cypher:</strong> You ask the GM for a specific subtle cypher (such as a "curative" or "stim") of a specific level. Make an Intellect roll with a difficulty equal to the cypher's level plus 1. If you have had the cypher before, the task is eased. If you succeed, the GM gives you the cypher.

			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="might">Might</h5>
			<p>Might governs how strong you are, how much physical punishment you can take, and how well you weather extreme conditions, poisons, toxins, and venom.

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="choosing-descriptor">Descriptor</h5>
			<p>The adjective is your <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>. A descriptor defines what you are like, including some strengths and weaknesses. In some settings, it might also describe your species or other unique things about your personal history. The GM might limit which descriptors are appropriate for the game setting. There are many descriptors, so it's unlikely two PCs in a group will need to use the same one.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Dozens of descriptors are detailed in <a href="#descriptor">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
			
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="choosing-type">Type</h5>
			<p>The noun is your character <a href="#type">type</a>&mdash;<a href="#type-adept">Adept</a>, <a href="#type-explorer">Explorer</a>, <a href="#type-speaker">Speaker</a>, or <a href="#type-warrior">Warrior</a>. Your character type defines your role in the world, and includes a broad choice of <a href="#ability">special abilities</a> you might want your character to have.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Types are very broad, so it's fine if two PCs have the same type&mdash;no two will be alike.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Types are detailed in <a href="#type">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
			
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="choosing-focus">Focus</h5>
			<p>The verb is your <a href="#focus">focus</a>. Focus is what your character does best, granting you new <a href="#ability">special abilities</a> each tier. Your focus also helps you understand how you relate with the other player characters in your group. The foci you choose from will probably depend on the setting and genre of your game.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Foci are unique. No two PCs in the group will have the same focus.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Over one hundred foci are detailed in <a href="#focus">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="choosing-arc">Character Arc</h5>
			<p>Just like in a book or a television show, characters progress through their own personal story, changing over time. A <a href="#arc">character arc</a> is a good way to communicate to the GM what kind of story you want to pursue.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Character arcs are a significant source of <a href="#xp">XP</a>.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Dozens of arcs are detailed in <a href="#arc">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
			<div class="alert pb-0">
				<h5 class="og-h-small" id="choosing-making-and-naming">Making and Naming Choices</h5>
				<p>Your descriptor and focus are less flexible than your type, so try narrowing those options down first. Then determine which type best fills in the gaps for your concept.</p>
				<p class="og-ind">It can help to start flavoring your character after on your character sheet by renaming your choices. For example, in a fairy tale setting, your character concept might be especially outlandish&mdash;a cartoon chipmunk inventor with a penchant for bringing phonographs to life, for example. You might end up choosing to be a "<a href="#descriptor-swift">Swift</a> <a href="#type-adept">Adept</a> who <a href="#focus-builds-robots">Builds Robots</a>", but present your character sentence as a "Chipmunk Horologist who Awakens Objects". Doing so anchors you in flavoring your actions and abilities, and helps make even a seemingly anachronistic focus feel natural to the setting.</p>
				<h5 class="og-h-small" id="#choosing-further-customization">Further Customization</h5>
				<p>Further customization and <a href="#flavor">flavor</a> are detailed in <a href="#customization">Chapter 7</a>. These optional rules all require the GM's involvement, so talk to the GM if you want to them.</p>

You slip, but it's just in time to duck an attack. You fall down, but you trip your enemies as you crash into their legs.

			<p class="og-ind">You were likely instilled with this sense of honor by a parent or a mentor. Sometimes the distinction between what is and isn't honorable varies with different schools of thought, but in broad strokes, honorable people can agree on most aspects of what honor means.</p>

			<p>You have a hard time tamping down your enthusiasm. Why wait when you can just do it (whatever it is) and get it done? You deal with problems when they arise rather than plan ahead. Putting out the small fires now prevents them from becoming one big fire later. You are the first to take risks, to jump in and lend a hand, to step into dark passages, and to find danger.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Your impulsiveness likely gets you into trouble. While others might take time to study the items they discover, you use such items without hesitation. After all, the best way to learn what something can do is to use it. When a cautious explorer might look around and check for danger nearby, you have to physically stop yourself from bulling on ahead. Why fuss around when the exciting thing is just ahead?</p>

				<p>Impulsive characters get into trouble. That's their thing, and that's fine. But if you're constantly dragging your fellow PCs into trouble (or worse, getting them seriously hurt or killed), that will be annoying, to say the least. A good rule of thumb is that impulsiveness doesn't always mean a predilection for doing the wrong thing. Sometimes it's the urge to do the right thing.</p>

			<p>Savage forces strong enough to destroy a world left you transformed. Either through latent mutations passed down from ancestors that survived the apocalypse, or because something about you reacts when you're exposed to radiation or some other mutagenic source, you are prone to mutation. You might look relatively similar to others of your species, or you might have one or more obvious physical differences that make it hard to disguise your nature. Not that you necessarily want to hide what you are; you might wish to proudly display what makes you different and, to your mind, better.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">You gain the following characteristics:</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Significant Mutations:</strong> Choose which option from the following list you'd like for your mutations. Whichever you choose, it is rolled for randomly; you don't select it.</p>
					<ul class="og-list-disc">

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><p><strong>Distinctive Mutations:</strong> You can choose if you want to have <a href="#distinctive-mutations">distinctive mutations</a> or not. If you do, choose the number, up to four distinctive mutations, which are rolled for randomly. (If the GM is using the <a href="index.html#optional-rule-transitory-mutations">transitory mutations</a> optional rule, you can only choose to have up to three distinctive mutations.)
				<li><p><strong>Cosmetic Mutations:</strong> You can choose if you want to have <a href="#cosmetic-mutations">cosmetic mutations</a> or not. If you do, choose whether you want one or two cosmetic mutations, which are rolled for randomly. Once all your mutations have been rolled for, work together with the GM to ensure that what's been rolled is a character you want to play.

			<p>You have lived your life deep underground in artificial bunkers, hidden from the world's destruction and the brutal scavengers that live above. As a morlock, you have a keen mind for the technology salvaged from the before-time. In fact, every morlock comes of age by fitting a piece of morlock technology to its body to provide enhancement and extend its life. This means that you are part flesh and part machine.

				<li><p><strong>Repair and Maintenance:</strong> As an entity of living flesh and humming machinery, you must first succeed on a difficulty 2 repair task before making a recovery roll. On a failure, the recovery roll is not used; however, the normal rules for retrying apply, and you must use <a href="#effort">Effort</a> on a new roll if you wish to try again. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to heal additional points to your Pools (each level of Effort healing an additional 2 points to your Pools if you succeed).</p></li>

			<p>You are born of a species of evolved insects once called "cockroach," but that is far in the past. Radiation and forced evolution have radically increased your size, shape, and ability to think. Your exoskeleton mimics the shape of a human being, though not perfectly. When you move about human society, shadows and cloaks are your ally if you wish to pass unnoticed. When those of your kind are discovered, it usually goes poorly for someone. You, however, have a wandering spirit and seek to explore the fallen world and find a new way forward.</p>

			<p>Life has dealt you some hard knocks. You lost an eye, an arm, or a leg several years ago, possibly during the apocalypse itself, or perhaps afterward. But you didn't give up. You adjusted, learning to do everything again, despite what first seemed like a limitation. If you lost a limb, you use a prosthetic; if an eye, you sometimes quip that binocular vision is overrated. Sure, there are times when you struggle with discomfort, pain, and possibly even self-consciousness. However, overcoming all that only makes you stronger and more determined to succeed. Ultimately, your scars, your prosthetic (if any), and your story represent who you are: a survivor who overcomes whatever is thrown your way.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">You gain the following characteristics:</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Resilient:</strong> +2 to your Might Pool or +2 to your Intellect Pool or +1 to all three Pools.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Skill:</strong> Hard knocks have toughened you; you are trained in either Might defense tasks or Intellect defense tasks (choose one).</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Skill:</strong> You had to fake it until you made it; you are trained in one creative skill such as singing, writing, acting, composing, public speaking, painting, sculpture, dancing, or something similar.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> You've learned to do everything again and, in truth, better than most people ever could. But your injury is real; it's why you sometimes joke that you're "rusted." If you've lost an eye, your perception tasks involving sight are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic leg, tasks requiring movement are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic arm, tasks involving using both hands are hindered.</p></li>

			<p>You're brash and bright, and you exult in situations, people, and objects that seem to  you as if they have a similar sheen. Literally shiny objects qualify, as well as objects that are not rusted or degraded by time's passage or the effects of the apocalypse. You also tend to fall into the orbit of people who are strong, unbeaten, and possessed of an inner brightness. You believe that they, like you, reflect the light of some greater spiritual purpose in the world. When you believe you are acting in that glow, you are emboldened and may take risks others fear. You don't seek death, but you're confident that death in the pursuit of something shiny is the definition of a life well-lived.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Skill:</strong> You know how to get out of the way. You are trained in Speed defense tasks.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Shiny Maneuver:</strong> You know how to push yourself harder, at the risk of a more dramatic failure. When you attempt a shiny maneuver, you ease a task, attack roll, or defense roll, but in doing so you increase the intrusion range by two for that roll, to a 1–3 on a d20. If you fail and decide to retry the task (requiring that you spend a level of Effort, as normal), it has the same increased intrusion range. Once you attempt a shiny maneuver, you can't attempt another until you make a recovery roll. Enabler.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> You may be lithe and shiny, but you're not sneaky. Tasks related to sneaking and staying quiet are hindered.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> You are irrepressible, but that makes it hard to dissemble. Deception and disguise tasks are hindered.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Additional Equipment:</strong> You have a treasured object that is literally shiny in bright light, such as a polished stainless-steel sphere, a silver coin, a pocket watch from the before-times, or something else small and easily carried.</p></li>

			<p class="og-ind">Artificially intelligent characters have machine minds of one type or another. This can involve an advanced computer brain, but it could also be a liquid computer, a quantum computer, or a network of smart dust particles creating an ambient intelligence. You might even have been an organic creature whose mind was uploaded into a machine.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Your body, of course, is also a machine. Most people refer to you as a robot or an android, although you know neither term describes you very well, as you are as free-willed and free-thinking as they are.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Limited Recovery:</strong> Resting restores points only to your Intellect Pool, not to your Might Pool or your Speed Pool.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Mechanics, Not Medicines:</strong> Conventional healing methods, including the vast majority of restorative devices and medicines, do not restore points to any of your Pools. You can recover points to your Intellect Pool only by resting, and you can recover points to your Speed and Might Pools only through repair. The difficulty of the repair task is equal to the number of points of damage sustained, to a maximum of 10. Repairing your Might and Speed Pools are always two different tasks.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Machine Vulnerabilities and Invulnerabilities:</strong> Damaging effects and other threats that rely on an organic system&mdash;poison, disease, cell disruption, and so on&mdash;have no effect on you.

Quintar have five genders, but all quintar prefer to be addressed as female when communicating with more binary species. Human emotions and sexuality fascinate them, but not because they don't have such concepts&mdash;quintar emotions and sexuality are just very different from those of humans.

Maybe good luck cancels out just enough of being cursed to count as a win. You've saved innocent lives, defeated some really bad people, and perhaps even cheated death a couple of times. Half the time you don't even know how you did it, but you succeeded at the impossible &mldr; often with a lot of collateral damage. When you hear police sirens, it's time to leave, but you know that trouble will find you eventually&mdash;and you'll be ready to smash it.</p>

			<p>The public and the press like you. Maybe you're photogenic, or you're inherently nice, or you have really good luck with journalists. Whatever the cause of it, you're the darling of the media, and whenever you're seen in public, you generate a lot of positive interest and excitement. (If you don't have a secret identity, this attention probably also carries over to your day job, which is a mixed blessing.) People know that you're a hero and that they can count on you to do the right thing&mdash;fighting crime, battling injustice, punching evil robots, that kind of stuff. Sometimes being in the public eye so much can be wearying or even a burden, but you know how to use your reputation to set a good example and make the world a better place.</p>

You get spotted by a guard, but they're dumbstruck for a moment because you're even more impressive in person than you are on TV. You attract a crowd of fans, but they slow down the fleeing villain you're trying to catch. A photographer pesters you for a photo and a quote, but their camera catches something interesting in the background. You and the GM should work together to determine the details.

			<p>Forgeborn&mdash;also called golems&mdash;are animate figures of metal, reanimated flesh, or other normally inert materials. Forgeborn are constructed for a specific purpose; their primary task is often to guard the alchemist that made them. As such, they usually ain't playing with a full deck when it comes to brains. You're different&mdash;somehow, you got a fully developed sense of self, and either never had or lost your compulsion to serve your maker. Maybe your alchemist creator emancipated you once they understood your animated form contained a fully realized mind, or maybe you ran away when the chance offered itself. Either way, you're on your own now, choosing your own goals and jobs.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Most folks who see you don't immediately realize you're not on the short leash of someone nearby. Maybe that's fine by you, since that keeps them from interfering in your business or asking too many pesky questions. Other times, you can't help it, and proudly proclaim your independent status to anyone and everyone.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Skill:</strong> You know your own kind. You are trained in tasks related to interacting with, identifying, tracking, or repairing other forgeborn.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Resistant:</strong> You gain two assets to defense rolls to resist effects that would daze or stun you, and you're immune to poison and disease.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Fixable:</strong> Even if you are killed, as long as all of your parts are collected, a willing alchemist who spends several days repairing you can bring you back with a successful difficulty 5 Intellect-based roll. However, the GM may decide you have some lasting damage, such as 2 fewer Pool points.</p></li>

					<li><p><strong>Absorb Kinetic Energy:</strong> You absorb a portion of the energy of a physical attack or impact. You negate 1 point of damage you would have suffered and store that point as energy.

Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p></li>

					<li><p><strong>Not Dead Yet:</strong> When you would normally be dead, you instead fall unconscious for one round and then awaken. You immediately gain 1d6 + 6 points to restore your stat Pools, and you are treated as if debilitated until you rest for ten hours. If you die again before you make your ten-hour recovery roll, you are truly dead. If you also have this ability from another source, your healing from this ability increases to 1d6 + 12. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(166)</span></p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Repair Flesh (3 Intellect points):</strong> When you touch an impaired or debilitated character, you can move them up one step on the damage track (for example, a debilitated PC becomes impaired, and an impaired one becomes hale). Alternatively, if you use this ability on a PC during a rest, you grant them a +2 bonus to their recovery roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(176)</span></p></li>
					<li><p><strong>See the Unseen:</strong> You can automatically perceive creatures and objects that are normally invisible, out of phase, or only partially in this universe. When looking for things more conventionally hidden, the task is eased. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(180)</span></p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Speaker for the Dead (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You can ask a question of a dead being whose corpse you are touching. Because the answer comes through the filter of the being's understanding and personality, it can't answer questions that it wouldn't have understood in life, and it can't provide answers that it wouldn't have known in life. In fact, the being is not compelled to answer at all, so you might need to interact with it in a way that would have convinced it to answer while it was alive.

			<p>They done you wrong and you ain't gonna rest until they've paid the price. Maybe the crime or betrayal that befell you was long ago, and you've been looking for the perpetrators' trail ever since, with only limited luck.

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<p>Your type helps determine your character's place in the world and relationship with other people in the setting.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">There are four character types: <a href="#type-adept">Adept</a>, <a href="#type-explorer">Explorer</a>, <a href="#type-speaker">Speaker</a>, and <a href="#type-warrior">Warrior</a>.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Type names are intentionally broad. A "Warrior" can be a "knight" in shining armor, a "cop" on the streets, or a grizzled "veteran" of futuristic wars. Each type offers possible names that might be more accurate or evocative for different genres.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p>It is tempting to think of your type as the equivalent of a "character class". In fact, your type is the most flexible part of your <a href="#sentence">character sentence</a> when it comes to choosing <a href="#ability">special abilities</a>. If you choose your <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> and <a href="#focus">focus</a> first, you'll be in a better position to decide which type best completes your character concept.</p>
			</div>
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="type-tier-1">Types at Tier 1</h5>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Your type determines your starting <a href="#stat">stat</a> <a href="#pool-edge">Pools</a>, with 6 additional points to divide among them however you wish. It also determines your starting <a href="#edge">Edge</a> for each stat. All types start with an <a href="#effort">Effort</a> score of 1.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Cypher Use:</strong> All types start the game with the ability to bear two <a href="#cypher">cyphers</a>, except the <a href="#type-adept">Adept</a>, which can bear three.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Your type determines your <a href="#skill">skill</a> with various kinds of <a href="#inflicting-damage">weapons</a>.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Your type offers you a collection of <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> by price category. Talk to the GM about what kind of equipment is available in the setting.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Player Intrusions:</strong> Each type suggests a few possible <a href="#player-intrusion">player intrusions</a> you can use by spending <a href="#xp">XP</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">			
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="type-background">Type Background Connection</h5>
			<p>Your background suggests connections you have with the world and the people in it. Talk to the GM about any characters your background demands that might appear in the story. Your conection might also infrom your decision of what kind of <a href="#arc">character arc</a> to pursue.</p>
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="type-abilities">Type Abilities</h5>
			<p>At tier 1, and each new tier you reach through <a href="#advancement">character advancement</a>, your type offers you a number of choices from a list of <a href="#ability">special abilities</a>. Each time you reach a new tier, you gain a number of abilities to choose from your type, which can be from your current tier or any lower tier. Additionally, you can exchange one type ability you've chosen for another of equal or lower tier.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p>If you complete your character statement and still feel like something is missing, talk to the GM and discuss the <a href="#customization">further customization</a> options in <a href="#customization">Chapter 7</a>, like adding a <a href="#flavor">flavor</a> to your type.</p>
				<p class="og-ind">Choosing <a href="#ability">special abilities</a> from lower tiers is a good way to ensure that you have exactly the character you want. This is particularly true with abilities that grant training with <a href="#skill">skills</a>&mdash;they can usually be taken multiple times.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Erase Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> You reach into the mind of a creature within immediate range and make an Intellect roll. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory. Action. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Far Step (2 Intellect points):</strong> You leap through the air and land some distance away. You can jump up, down, or across to anywhere you choose within long range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to that location. You land safely. Action. <span class="og-ref">(138)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Hedge Magic (1 Intellect point):</strong> You can perform small tricks: temporarily change the color or basic appearance of a small object, cause small objects to float through the air, clean a small area, mend a broken object, prepare (but not create) food, and so on. You can't use Hedge Magic to harm another creature or object. Action. <span class="og-ref">(149)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Magic Training:</strong> You are trained in the basics of magic (including the operation of magic artifacts and cyphers) and can attempt to understand and identify its properties. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(159)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Onslaught (1 Intellect point):</strong> You attack a foe using energies that assail either their physical form or their mind. In either case, you must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you emit a short-range ray of force that inflicts 4 points of damage. If the attack is mental, you focus your mental energy to blast the thought processes of another creature within short range. This mindslice inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). Some creatures without minds (such as robots) might be immune to your mindslice. Action. <span class="og-ref">(167)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Push (2 Intellect points):</strong> You telekinetically push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you can't use this ability to pull a lever or close a door. Action. <span class="og-ref">(173)</span></p></li>

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Resonance Field (1 Intellect point):</strong> Faint lines in a color you choose form a tracery over your entire body and emit faint light. The effect lasts for one minute. Whenever a creature within immediate range makes an attack against you, the pattern energizes to block the attack. You can make an Intellect defense roll in place of the defense roll you would normally make. If you do so and you get a minor effect the creature attacking you takes 1 point of damage. If you get a major effect the creature attacking you takes 4 points of damage. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(176)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Scan (2 Intellect points):</strong> You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and plastic. You might learn that the glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this ability doesn't tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don't know what the metal and plastic device does. In the second, you don't know if stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action. <span class="og-ref">(179)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Shatter (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You interrupt the fundamental force holding normal matter together for a moment, causing the detonation of an object you choose within long range. The object must be a small, mundane item composed of homogeneous matter (such as a clay cup, an iron ingot, a stone, and so on). The object explodes in an immediate radius, dealing 1 point of damage to all creatures and objects in the area. If you apply Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(182)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Ward:</strong> You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p></li>

Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Cutting Light (2 Intellect points):</strong> You emit a thin beam of energized light from your hand. This inflicts 5 points of damage to a single foe in immediate range. The beam is even more effective against immobile, nonliving targets, slicing up to 1 foot (30 cm) of any material that is level 6 or lower. The material can be up to 1 foot thick. Action. <span class="og-ref">(123)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Hover (2 Intellect points):</strong> You float slowly into the air. If you concentrate, you can control your movement to remain motionless in the air or float up to a short distance as your action; otherwise, you drift with the wind or with any momentum you have gained. This effect lasts for up to ten minutes. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(149)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Mind Reading (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short range, even if the target doesn't want you to. You must be able to see your target. Once you have established contact, you can read the target's thoughts for up to one minute. If you also have the Mind Reading special ability from another source, you can use this ability at long range, and you don't need to be able to see the target (but you do have to know that the target is within range).

		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Retrieve Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> You touch the remains of a recently killed creature and make an Intellect-based roll to restore its mind to life long enough to learn information from it. The GM sets the difficulty based on the amount of time that has passed since the creature died. A creature that has been dead for only a few minutes is a difficulty 2 task, one that has been dead for an hour is a difficulty 4 task, and one that has been dead for a few days is a difficulty 9 task. If you succeed, you awaken the corpse, causing its head to animate and perceive things as if it were alive. This enables communication for about one minute, which is how long it takes for the creature to realize that it's dead. The creature is limited to what it knew in life, though it cannot recall minor memories, only big events of importance to it. When the effect ends, or if you fail the roll, the creature's brain dissolves to mush and cannot be awakened again. Action. <span class="og-ref">(177)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Reveal (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You adjust a creature's eyesight so that it can see normally in areas of dim light and darkness. You can affect one willing creature within immediate range for one hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort applied affects two additional targets. You must touch additional targets to affect them. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(178)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Stasis (3 Intellect points):</strong> You surround a foe of your size or smaller with scintillating energy, keeping it from moving or acting for one minute, as if frozen solid. You must be able to see the target, and it must be within short range. While in stasis, the target is impervious to harm, cannot be moved, and is immune to all effects.

				<li><p><strong>Adroit Cypher Use:</strong> You can bear four cyphers at a time. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Countermeasures (4 Intellect points):</strong> You immediately end one ongoing effect (such as an effect created by a character ability) within immediate range. Alternatively, you can use this as a defense action to cancel any incoming ability targeted at you, or you can cancel any device or the effect of any device for 1d6 rounds. You must touch the effect or device to cancel it. Action. <span class="og-ref">(122)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Energy Protection (3+ Intellect points):</strong> Choose a discrete type of energy that you have experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You gain +10 to Armor against damage from that type of energy for ten minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor against damage from that energy for 24 hours. You must be familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience with a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you can't protect against it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to protect more targets; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to two additional targets. You must touch additional targets to protect them. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(134)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Fire and Ice (4 Intellect points):</strong> You cause a target within short range to become either very hot or very cold (your choice). The target suffers 3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor) each round for up to three rounds, although a new roll is required each round to continue to affect the target. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(140)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Force Field Barrier (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You create an opaque, stationary barrier of solid energy (a force field) within immediate range. The barrier is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) and of negligible thickness. It is a level 2 barrier and lasts for ten minutes. It can be placed anywhere it fits, whether against a solid object (including the ground) or floating in the air. Each level of Effort you apply strengthens the barrier by one level. For example, applying two levels of Effort creates a level 4 barrier. Action. <span class="og-ref">(143)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Sensor (4 Intellect points):</strong> You create an immobile, invisible sensor within immediate range that lasts for 24 hours. At any time during that duration, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell through the sensor, no matter how far you move from it. The sensor doesn't grant you sensory capabilities beyond the norm. If you also have this ability from another source, it lasts twice as long. Action to create; action to check. <span class="og-ref">(181)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Targeting Eye:</strong> You are trained in any physical ranged attack that is a character ability or comes from a device. For example, you are trained when using an Onslaught force blast because it's a physical attack, but not when using an Onslaught mindslice because it's a mental attack. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Death Touch (6 Intellect points):</strong> You gather disrupting energy in your fingertip and touch a creature. If the target is an NPC or a creature of level 3 or lower, it dies. If the target is a PC of any tier, they move down one step on the damage track. Action. <span class="og-ref">(125)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Exile (5 Intellect points):</strong> You send a target that you touch hurtling into another random dimension or universe, where it remains for ten minutes. You have no idea what happens to the target while it's gone, but at the end of ten minutes, it returns to the precise spot it left. Action. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Invisibility (4 Intellect points):</strong> You become invisible for ten minutes. While invisible, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position&mdash;attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to hide your position. If you have another ability that also confers invisibility, using either one allows you to remain invisible for twice as long as the duration specified. Action to initiate or reinitiate. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Matter Cloud (5 Intellect points):</strong> Pebbles, dirt, sand, and debris rise into the air around you to form a swirling cloud. The cloud extends out to immediate range, moves with you, and lasts for one minute. When it ends, all the materials fall to the ground around you. The cloud makes it harder for other creatures to attack you, giving you an asset on Speed defense rolls. In addition, while the cloud is around you, you can use an action to whip the material so that it abrades everything within immediate range, dealing 1 point of damage to each creature and object in the area. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(161)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Mind Control (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You control the actions of another creature you touch. This effect lasts for one minute. The target must be level 2 or lower. Once you have established control, you maintain mental contact with the target and sense what it senses. You can allow it to act freely or override its control on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to control the mind of a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit) or control a target for four minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must apply three levels of Effort. When the duration ends, the creature doesn't remember being controlled or anything it did while under your command. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(162)</span></p></li>

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Projection (4 Intellect points):</strong> You project an image of yourself to any location you have seen or previously visited. Distance does not matter as long as the location is on the same world as you. The projection copies your appearance, movements, and any sounds you make for the next ten minutes. Anyone present at the location can see and hear you as if you were there. However, you do not perceive through your projection. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(172)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Rapid Processing (6 Intellect points):</strong> You or a target you touch experiences a higher level of mental and physical reaction time for about a minute. During that period, all Speed tasks (including Speed defense rolls) are eased. In addition, the target can take one extra action at any time before the ability's duration expires. Action. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Regeneration (6 Intellect points):</strong> You restore points to a target's Might or Speed Pool in one of two ways: either the chosen Pool regains up to 6 points, or it is restored to a total value of 12. You make this decision when you initiate this ability. Points are regenerated at a rate of 1 point each round. You must remain within immediate range of the target the whole time, either touching them or conversing with them. In no case can this raise a Pool higher than its maximum. Action. <span class="og-ref">(175)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Reshape (5 Intellect points):</strong> You reshape matter within short range in an area no larger than a 5-foot (1.5 m) cube. If you use only one action on this ability, the changes you make are crude at best. If you spend at least ten minutes and succeed at a hindered appropriate crafting task, you can make complex changes to the material. You can't change the nature of the material, only its shape. Thus, you can make a hole in a wall or floor, or you can seal one up. You can fashion a rudimentary sword from a large piece of iron. You can break or repair a chain. With multiple uses of this ability, you could bring about large changes, making a bridge, a wall, or a similar structure. Action. <span class="og-ref">(176)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Wormhole (6 Intellect points):</strong> You create a doorway through time and space. The shortcut manifests as a hole in reality large enough to accommodate you and creatures of your size or smaller. One side of the doorway appears anywhere within immediate range, and the other side opens at a spot you choose anywhere within long range. Any character or object moving into one side exits from the other. The door remains open for one minute or until you use an action to close it. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(200)</span></p></li>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Absorb Energy (7 Intellect points):</strong> You touch an object and absorb its energy. If you touch a manifest cypher, you render it useless. If you touch an artifact, roll for its depletion. If you touch another kind of powered machine or device, the GM determines whether its power is fully drained. In any case, you absorb energy from the object touched and regain 1d10 Intellect points. If this would give you more Intellect than your Pool's maximum, the extra points are lost, and you must make a Might defense roll. The difficulty of the roll is equal to the number of points over your maximum you absorbed. If you fail the roll, you take 5 points of damage and are unable to act for one round. You can use this ability as a defense action when you're the target of an incoming ability. Doing so cancels the incoming ability, and you absorb the energy as if it were a device. Action. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Concussion (7 Intellect points):</strong> You cause a pulse of concussive force to explode out from a point you choose within long range. The pulse extends up to short range in all directions, dealing 5 points of damage to everything in the area. Even if you fail the attack roll, targets in the area take 1 point of damage. Action. <span class="og-ref">(121)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Conjuration (7 Intellect points):</strong> You produce, as if from thin air, a level 5 creature of a kind you have previously encountered. The creature remains for one minute and then returns home. While present, the creature acts as you direct, but this requires no action on your part. Action. <span class="og-ref">(121)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Create (7 Intellect points):</strong> You create something from nothing. You can create any item you choose that would ordinarily have a difficulty of 5 or lower (using the crafting rules). Once created, the item lasts for a number of hours equal to 6 minus the difficulty to create it. Thus, if you create a set of sturdy manacles (difficulty 5), it would last for one hour.

			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Dust to Dust (7 Intellect points):</strong> You disintegrate one object that is smaller than you and whose level is less than or equal to your tier. You must touch the object to affect it. If the GM feels it appropriate to the circumstances, you can disintegrate a portion of an object (the total volume of which is smaller than you) rather than the entire thing. Action. <span class="og-ref">(133)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Knowing the Unknown (6 Intellect points):</strong> By accessing the resources appropriate to your character, you can ask the GM one question and get a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. Action. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Master Cypher Use:</strong> You can bear five cyphers at a time. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(160)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Teleportation (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You instantaneously transmit yourself to any location that you have seen or been to, no matter the distance, as long as it is on Earth (or whatever world you're currently on). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. You must touch any additional targets. Action. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>True Senses:</strong> You can see in complete darkness up to 50 feet (15 m) as if it were dim light. You recognize holograms, disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry, and other such tricks (for all senses) for what they are. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Control Weather (10 Intellect points):</strong> You change the weather in your general region. If performed indoors, this creates minor effects, such as mist, mild temperature changes, and so on. If performed outside, you can create rain, fog, snow, wind, or any other kind of normal (not overly severe) weather. The change lasts for a natural length of time so that a storm might last for an hour, fog for two or three hours, and snow for a few hours (or for ten minutes if it's out of season). For the first ten minutes after activating this ability, you can create more dramatic and specific effects, such as lightning strikes, giant hailstones, twisters, hurricane-force winds, and so on. These effects must occur within 1,000 feet (300 m) of your location. You must spend your turn concentrating to create an effect or maintain it in a new round. These effects inflict 6 points of damage each round. If you have this ability from another source, the cost for the ability is 7 Intellect points instead of 10. If you already have the Storm Seed ability, you can immediately replace it with a new ability of the same tier. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(122)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Earthquake (7 Might points):</strong> You direct your destructive resonance into the ground and trigger an earthquake centered on a spot you can see within very long range. The ground within short range of that spot heaves and shakes for five minutes, causing damage to structures and terrain in the area. Buildings and terrain features shed debris and rubble. Each round, creatures in the area take either 3 points of damage due to the general shaking, or 6 points of damage if in or adjacent to a structure or terrain feature shedding debris.

Action. <span class="og-ref">(164)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Traverse the Worlds (8+ Intellect points):</strong> You instantaneously transmit yourself to another planet, dimension, plane, or level of reality. You must know that the destination exists; the GM will decide if you have enough information to confirm its existence and the level of difficulty to reach the destination. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. You must touch any additional targets. Action. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Usurp Cypher:</strong> Choose one cypher that you carry. The cypher must have an effect that is not instantaneous. You destroy the cypher and gain its power, which functions for you continuously. You can choose a cypher when you gain this ability, or you can wait and make the choice later.

	<p>Chose four:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Block (3 Speed points):</strong> You automatically block the next melee attack made against you within the next minute. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(115)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Danger Sense (1 Speed point):</strong> Your initiative task is eased. You pay the cost each time the ability is used. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(124)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Decipher (1 Intellect point):</strong> If you spend one minute examining a piece of writing or code in a language you do not understand, you can make an Intellect roll of difficulty 3 (or higher, based on the complexity of the language or code) to get the gist of the message. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(126)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Any duration dealing with physical actions is either doubled or halved, whichever is better for you. For example, if the typical person can hold their breath for thirty seconds, you can hold it for one minute. If the typical person can march for four hours without stopping, you can do so for eight hours. In terms of harmful effects, if a poison paralyzes its victims for one minute, you are paralyzed for thirty seconds. The minimum duration is always one round. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(134)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Find the Way:</strong> When you apply Effort to a navigation task because you don't know the way, are lost, are attempting to blaze a new route, need to choose between two or more otherwise similar paths to take, or something very similar, you can apply a free level of Effort. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(140)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Fleet of Foot (1+ Speed points):</strong> You can move a short distance as part of another action. You can move a long distance as your entire action for a turn. If you apply a level of Effort to this ability, you can move a long distance and make an attack as your entire action for a turn, but the attack is hindered. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(141)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Knowledge Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two areas of knowledge such as history, geography, archeology, and so on. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(157)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Muscles of Iron (2 Might points):</strong> For the next ten minutes, all Might-based actions other than attack rolls that you attempt are eased. If you already have this ability from another source, the effect of this ability lasts for one hour instead of ten minutes. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(165)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>No Need for Weapons:</strong> When you make an unarmed attack (such as a punch or kick), it counts as a medium weapon instead of a light weapon. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(166)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Physical Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: balancing, climbing, jumping, running, or swimming. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(170)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Practiced in Armor:</strong> You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1. You start the game with a type of armor of your choice. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(171)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Practiced With All Weapons:</strong> You become practiced with light, medium, and heavy weapons and suffer no penalty when using any kind of weapon. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(171)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Surging Confidence (1 Might point):</strong> When you use an action to make your first recovery roll of the day, you immediately gain another action. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(188)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Trained Without Armor:</strong> You are trained in Speed defense tasks when not wearing armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>

	<h5 class="og-h-small og-border" id="explorer-t2">Tier 2 Explorer Abilities<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#explorer-t2" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
	<p>Choose four:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Curious:</strong> You're always curious about your surroundings, even on a subconscious level. Whenever you use Effort to attempt navigation, perception, or initiative tasks in an area that you've only rarely or never visited before, you can apply an additional free level of Effort. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(123)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Danger Instinct (3 Speed points):</strong> If you are attacked by surprise, whether by a creature, a device, or simply an environmental hazard (a tree falling on you), you can move an immediate distance before the attack occurs. If moving prevents the attack, you are safe. If the attack can still potentially affect you&mdash;if the attacking creature can move to keep pace, if the attack fills an area too big to escape, etc. &mdash;the ability offers no benefit. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(124)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Enable Others:</strong> You can use the helping rules to provide a benefit to another character attempting a physical task. Unlike the normal helping rules, this doesn't require you to use your action helping the other character with the task. This requires no action on your part. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(133)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Escape (2 Speed points):</strong> You slip your restraints, squeeze through the bars, break the grip of a creature holding you, pull free from sucking quicksand, or otherwise get loose from whatever is holding you in place. Action. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Eye for Detail (2 Intellect points):</strong> When you spend five minutes or so thoroughly exploring an area no larger than a short distance in diameter, you can ask the GM one question about the area. The GM must answer you truthfully. You cannot use this more than one time per area per 24 hours. Action to initiate, five minutes to complete. <span class="og-ref">(138)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Foil Danger (2 Intellect points):</strong> You negate one source of potential danger related to one creature or object that you are aware of within immediate distance for one round. This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a trap triggered by a pressure plate, or a creature's natural ability (something special, innate, and dangerous, like a dragon's fiery breath or a giant cobra's venom). You can also try to foil a foe's mundane action (such as an attack with a weapon or claw), so that the action isn't made this round. Make your roll against the level of the attack, danger, or creature. Action. <span class="og-ref">(142)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Hand to Eye (2 Speed points):</strong> This ability provides an asset to any tasks involving manual dexterity, such as pickpocketing, lockpicking, games involving agility, and so on. Each use lasts up to a minute; a new use (to switch tasks) replaces the previous use. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(148)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Investigative Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: perception, identifying, lockpicking, assessing danger, or tinkering with devices. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Quick Recovery:</strong> Your second recovery roll (usually requiring ten minutes) is only a single action. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(173)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Range Increase:</strong> Ranges for you increase by one step. Immediate becomes short, short becomes long, long becomes very long, and very long becomes 1,000 feet (300 m). Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Skill With Defense:</strong> Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(183)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Stand Watch (2 Intellect points):</strong> While standing watch (mostly remaining in place for an extended period of time), you unfailingly remain awake and alert for up to eight hours. During this time, you are trained in perception tasks as well as stealth tasks to conceal yourself from those who might approach. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(186)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Travel Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: navigation, riding, running, piloting, or vehicle driving. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Wreck:</strong> Using two hands, you wield a weapon or a tool with a powerful swing. (If fighting unarmed, this attack is made with both fists or both feet together.) When using this as an attack, you take a &minus;1 penalty to the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of damage. When attempting to damage an object or barrier, you are trained in the task. Action. <span class="og-ref">(200)</span></p></li>

	<p>Choose three:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Controlled Fall:</strong> When you fall while you are able to use actions and within reach of a vertical surface, you can attempt to slow your fall. Make a Speed roll with a difficulty of 1 for every 20 feet (6 m) you fall. On a success, you take half damage from the fall. If you reduce the difficulty to 0, you take no damage. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(122)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Experienced in Armor:</strong> The cost reduction from your Practiced in Armor ability improves. You now reduce the Speed cost by 2. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Expert Cypher Use:</strong> You can bear three cyphers at a time. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(137)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Ignore the Pain:</strong> You ignore the impaired condition and treat the debilitated condition as impaired. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(150)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Obstacle Running (3 Speed points):</strong> For the next minute, you can ignore obstacles that slow your movement, allowing you to travel at normal speed through areas with rubble, fences, tables, and similar objects that you would have to climb over or move around. This movement might include sliding on a railing, briefly running along a wall, or even stepping on a creature to boost yourself over something. If an obstacle would normally require a Might or Speed task to overcome, such as swinging on a rope, balancing on a rope, or jumping over a hole, you are trained in that task. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(167)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Resilience:</strong> You have 1 point of Armor against any kind of physical damage, even physical damage that normally ignores Armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(176)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Run and Fight (4 Might points):</strong> You can move a short distance and make a melee attack that inflicts 2 additional points of damage. Action. <span class="og-ref">(179)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Seize the Moment (4+ Speed points):</strong> If you succeed on a Speed defense roll to resist an attack, you gain an action. You can use the action immediately even if you have already taken a turn in the round. You don't take an action during the next round, unless you apply a level of Effort when you use Seize the Moment. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(181)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Skill With Attacks:</strong> Choose one type of attack in which you are not already trained: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of attack. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(183)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Stone Breaker:</strong> Your attacks against objects inflict 4 additional points of damage when you use a melee weapon that you wield in two hands. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(186)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Think Your Way Out:</strong> When you wish it, you can use points from your Intellect Pool rather than your Might Pool or Speed Pool on any noncombat action. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(191)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Trapfinder (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You find any traps (like a floor that would give way beneath you) or mechanical triggers to a trap or defense system that might pose a threat. You can do this without setting them off and in lieu of making a roll to find them. This ability can find traps of level 4 or below. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of traps that can be found by 2, so using two levels of Effort can find all traps of level 8 or below. Action. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Wrest From Chance:</strong> If you roll a natural 1 on a d20, you can reroll the die. If you reroll, you avoid a <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a>&mdash;unless you roll a second 1&mdash;and might succeed on your task. Once you use this ability, it is not available again until after you make a ten-hour recovery roll. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(200)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Read the Signs (4 Intellect points):</strong> You examine an area and learn precise, useful details about the past (if any exist). You can ask the GM up to four questions about the immediate area; each requires its own roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>

If you fail at the jump, you still make your normal attack roll, but you don't inflict the extra damage or knock down the opponent if you hit.

				<li><p><strong>Spin Attack (5+ Speed points):</strong> You stand still and make attacks against up to five foes, all as part of the same action in one round. All of the attacks have to be the same sort of attack (melee or ranged). Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action.

	<p>Choose four:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Anecdote (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can lift the spirits of a group of creatures and help them bond together by entertaining them with an uplifting or pointed anecdote. For the next hour, those who pay attention to your story are trained in a task you choose that's related to the anecdote, as long as it's not an attack or defense task. Action to initiate, one minute to complete. <span class="og-ref">(109)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Babel:</strong> After hearing a language spoken for a few minutes, you can speak it and make yourself understood. If you continue to use the language to interact with native speakers, your skills improve rapidly, to the point where you might be mistaken for a native speaker after just a few hours of speaking the new language. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Demeanor of Command (2 Intellect points):</strong> You project confidence, knowledge, and charisma to all who see you for the next hour. Your demeanor is such that those who see you automatically understand that you are someone important, accomplished, and with authority. When you speak, strangers who are not already attacking give you at least a round to have your say. If speaking to a group that can understand you, you can attempt to have them produce their leader or ask that they take you to their leader. You gain a free level of Effort that can be applied to one persuasion task you attempt during this period. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Encouragement (1 Intellect point):</strong> While you maintain this ability through ongoing inspiring oration, your allies within short range ease one of the following task types (your choice): defense tasks, attack tasks, or tasks related to any skill that you are trained or specialized in. Action. <span class="og-ref">(134)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Enthrall (1 Intellect point):</strong> While talking, you grab and keep another creature's attention, even if the creature can't understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can't even move), the other creature takes no actions other than to defend itself, even over multiple rounds. If the creature is attacked, the effect ends. Action. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Erase Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> You reach into the mind of a creature within immediate range and make an Intellect roll. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory. Action. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Fast Talk (1 Intellect point):</strong> When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn't hostile, you convince that creature to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. Action. <span class="og-ref">(138)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Inspire Aggression (2 Intellect points):</strong> Your words twist the mind of a character within short range who is able to understand you, unlocking their more primitive instincts. As a result, they gain an asset on their Might-based attack rolls for one minute. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(154)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Interaction Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: deceiving, persuading, public speaking, seeing through deception, or intimidation. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Practiced With Medium Weapons:</strong> You can use light and medium weapons without penalty. If you wield a heavy weapon, attacks with it are hindered. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(171)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Spin Identity (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You convince all intelligent creatures who can see, hear, and understand you that you are someone or something other than who you actually are. You don't impersonate a specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you convince the victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain category of people. "We're from the government." "I'm just a simple farmer from the next town over." "Your commander sent me." A disguise isn't necessary, but a good disguise will almost certainly be an asset to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one creature, the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled creatures remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other circumstances reveal your true identity earlier. Action. <span class="og-ref">(185)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Terrifying Presence (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You convince one intelligent target of level 3 or lower that you are its worst nightmare. The target must be within short range and be able to understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can't even move), the target is paralyzed with fear, runs away, or takes some other action appropriate to the circumstances. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to terrorize a level 5 target (two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two levels of Effort. Action. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Understanding (1 Intellect point):</strong> You observe or study a creature or object. Your next interaction with that creature or object gains one asset. Action. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p></li>

	<p>Choose two:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Basic Follower:</strong> You gain a level 2 <a href="#follower">follower</a>. One of their modifications must be persuasion. You can take this ability multiple times, each time gaining another level 2 follower. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p>When you use Basic Follower, the GM may require that you actually look for a suitable follower.</p>					
			</div>
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Calm Stranger (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You can cause one intelligent creature to remain calm as you speak. The creature doesn't need to speak your language, but it must be able to see you. It remains calm as long as you focus all your attention on it and it is not attacked or otherwise threatened. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to calm additional creatures allied with your initial target, one additional creature per level of Effort applied. Action. <span class="og-ref">(118)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Disincentivize (1 Intellect point):</strong> You hinder all actions attempted by any number of targets within short range who can understand you. You choose which targets are affected. Affected targets' actions are hindered for one round. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(129)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Gather Intelligence (2 Intellect points):</strong> When in a group of people (a caravan, a palace, a village, a city, etc.) you can ask around about any topic you choose and come away with useful information. You can ask a specific question, or you can simply obtain general facts. You also get a good idea of the general layout of the location involved, note the presence of all major sites, and perhaps even notice obscure details. For example, not only do you find out if anyone in the palace has seen the missing boy, but you also get a working knowledge of the layout of the palace itself, note all the entrances and which are used more often than others, and take notice that everyone seems to avoid the well in the eastern courtyard for some reason. Action to initiate, about an hour to complete. <span class="og-ref">(144)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Impart Ideal (3 Intellect points):</strong> After interacting for at least one minute with a creature who can hear and understand you, you can attempt to temporarily impart an ideal to it that you could not otherwise convince it to adopt. An ideal is different than a specific suggestion or command; an ideal is an overarching value such as "All life is sacred," "My political party is the best," "Children should be seen, not heard," and so on. An ideal influences a creature's behavior but doesn't control it. The imparted ideal lasts as long as befits the situation, but usually at least a few hours. The ideal is jeopardized if someone friendly to the creature spends a minute or more bringing it back to its senses. Action. <span class="og-ref">(151)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Inspiring Ease:</strong> Through stories, songs, art, or other forms of entertainment, you inspire your friends. After spending 24 hours with you, once per day each of your friends can ease a task. This benefit is ongoing while you remain in the friend's company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to the friend's company within 24 hours. If you leave the friend's company for more than 24 hours, you must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(154)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Interaction Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: deceiving, persuading, public speaking, seeing through deception, or intimidation. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Practiced in Armor:</strong> You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1. You start the game with a type of armor of your choice. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(171)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Skill With Defense:</strong> Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(183)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Speedy Recovery (3 Intellect points):</strong> Your words enhance the normal regenerative ability of a character within short range who is able to understand you. When they make a recovery roll, they must spend only half the normal amount of time required to do so (minimum one action). Action. <span class="og-ref">(185)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Unexpected Betrayal:</strong> Within a round or two of successfully using Enthrall, Fast Talk, or a similar ability on a target within short range, the first attack you make on that target is eased by two steps. Once you use Unexpected Betrayal on a target, using your abilities or attempting simple persuasion on that target is permanently hindered by two steps. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(195)</span></p></li>

	<p>Choose three:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Accelerate (4+ Intellect points):</strong> Your words imbue the spirit of a character within immediate range who is able to understand you, accelerating them so they gain an asset on initiative tasks and Speed defense rolls for ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional target. You must speak to additional targets to accelerate them, one target per round. Action per target to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Blend In (4 Intellect points):</strong> When you blend in, creatures still see you, but they attach no importance to your presence for about a minute. While blending in, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position&mdash;attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining period of effect by taking an action to focus on seeming innocuous and as if you belong. Action to initiate or reinitiate. <span class="og-ref">(113)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Discerning Mind:</strong> You have +3 Armor against damaging attacks and damaging effects that target your mind and Intellect. Defense rolls you make against attacks that attempt to confuse, persuade, frighten, or otherwise influence you are eased. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(129)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Expert Cypher Use:</strong> You can bear three cyphers at a time. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(137)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Expert Follower:</strong> You gain a level 3 <a href="#follower">follower</a>. They are not restricted on their modifications. You can take this ability multiple times, each time gaining another level 3 follower. Alternatively, you could choose to advance a level 2 follower you already have to level 3 and then gain a new level 2 follower. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(137)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Grand Deception (3 Intellect points):</strong> You convince an intelligent creature that can understand you and isn't hostile of something that is wildly and obviously untrue. Action. <span class="og-ref">(146)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Lead by Inquiry:</strong> You keep your allies on their toes with occasional questions, jokes, and even mock drills for those who care to join in. After spending 24 hours with you, your allies are treated as if trained in tasks related to perception. This benefit is ongoing while you remain in your allies' company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to the allies' company within 24 hours. If you leave the allies' company for more than 24 hours, you must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(157)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Mind Reading (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short range, even if the target doesn't want you to. You must be able to see your target. Once you have established contact, you can read the target's thoughts for up to one minute. If you also have the Mind Reading special ability from another source, you can use this ability at long range, and you don't need to be able to see the target (but you do have to know that the target is within range). Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(162)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Oratory (4 Intellect points):</strong> When speaking with a group of intelligent creatures that can understand you and aren't hostile, you convince them to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action should not put the creatures or their allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. Action. <span class="og-ref">(167)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Perfect Stranger (3 Intellect points):</strong> You alter your posture and way of speaking and make a small but real alteration to an outfit (such as putting on or taking off a hat, reversing a cloak, and so on). For the next hour (or as long as you keep up the alteration), even creatures that know you well don't recognize you. All tasks related to hiding your true identity during this period gain one free level of Effort. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(169)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Quick Wits:</strong> When performing a task that would normally require spending points from your Intellect Pool, you can spend points from your Speed Pool instead. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Telling (2 Intellect points):</strong> This ability provides an asset to any tasks for attempting to deceive, persuade, or intimidate. Each use lasts up to a minute; a new use (to switch tasks) replaces the previous use. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Confounding Banter (4 Intellect points):</strong> You spew a stream of nonsense to distract a foe within immediate range. On a successful Intellect roll, your defense roll against the creature's next attack before the end of the next round is eased. Action. <span class="og-ref">(121)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Feint (2 Speed points):</strong> If you use one action creating a misdirection or diversion, in the next round you can take advantage of your opponent's lowered defenses.

If you choose a task you're already trained in, you instead become specialized in that task. You can't choose a task you're already specialized in. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(149)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Psychosis (4 Intellect points):</strong> Your words inflict a destructive psychosis in the mind of a target within long range that can understand you, dealing 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) per round. The psychosis can be dispersed if a target uses an action doing nothing but calming and centering itself. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(172)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Read the Signs (4 Intellect points):</strong> You examine an area and learn precise, useful details about the past (if any exist). You can ask the GM up to four questions about the immediate area; each requires its own roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Strategize (6 Intellect points):</strong> Having an action plan in place before facing a challenge improves the odds of success, even if that plan is eventually changed or discarded once it's put into play. If you and your allies spend at least ten minutes going over a plan of action, all of you gain one free level of Effort that can be applied to one task you attempt during the execution of that plan within the next 24 hours.

After spending 24 hours with you, your allies can apply a free level of Effort to any initiative tasks they attempt. This benefit is ongoing while you remain in the allies' company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to the allies' company within 24 hours. If you leave the allies' company for more than 24 hours, you must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit.

Creatures that can hear and understand you feel an urge to move at least a short distance away from the object. If a creature does not move away, all tasks, attacks, and defenses it attempts while within the aura are hindered. The duration of the aura is extended by one day per level of Effort applied. The aura is temporarily blocked while the object is covered or contained. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(143)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Knowing the Unknown (6 Intellect points):</strong> By accessing the resources appropriate to your character, you can ask the GM one question and get a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. Action. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Regeneration (6 Intellect points):</strong> You restore points to a target's Might or Speed Pool in one of two ways: either the chosen Pool regains up to 6 points, or it is restored to a total value of 12. You make this decision when you initiate this ability. Points are regenerated at a rate of 1 point each round. You must remain within immediate range of the target the whole time, either touching them or conversing with them. In no case can this raise a Pool higher than its maximum.

				<li><p><strong>Assume Control (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You control the actions of another creature you have interacted with or studied for at least a round. This effect lasts for ten minutes. The target must be level 2 or lower. Once you have assumed control, the target acts as if it wants to accomplish your desire to the best of its ability, freely using its own best judgment unless you use an action to give it a specific instruction on an issue-by-issue basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to attempt to command a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. When the effect ends, the target remembers everything that happened and reacts according to its nature and your relationship to it; assuming control might have soured that relationship if it was previously a positive one. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(111)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Battle Management (4 Intellect points):</strong> As long as you use your action each round giving orders or advice, attack and defense actions taken by your allies within short range are eased. Action. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Crowd Control (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You control the actions of up to five creatures in short range. This effect lasts for one minute. All targets must be level 2 or lower. Your control is limited to simple verbal commands like "Stop," "Run away," "Follow that guard," "Look over there," or "Get out of my way." All affected creatures respond to the command unless you specifically command them otherwise. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the targets or affect an additional five people. Thus, to control a group that has a level 4 target (two levels above the normal limit) or a group of fifteen people, you must apply two levels of Effort. When the Crowd Control ability ends, the creatures remember your commands but don't remember being controlled&mdash;your commands seemed reasonable at the time.

They destroy tissue, memories, and personality, triggering a vegetative state. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target.

				<li><p><strong>Reaction:</strong> If a creature you attacked on your last turn with a melee attack uses its action to move out of immediate range, you gain an action to attack the creature as a parting blow, even if you have already taken a turn in the round.

				<li><p><strong>Spray (2 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow or submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. This ability uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). You are trained in making this attack.

Make a separate attack roll against each target. The attack rolls are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Vigilance (2 Intellect points):</strong> You take a cautious approach to combat, focusing more on protecting yourself than on hurting your opponents. While this ability is active, you gain an asset on Speed defense rolls against melee and ranged attacks, and your melee and ranged attacks are hindered. This effect lasts for as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is taking place within range of your senses. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p></li>

			<p>A hack is an attempt to control, override, shut down, or influence a computer system, usually performed by exploiting a weakness in the system, such as spoofing an administrator's login, using a "back door" to access information, or uploading a virus to unlock functions that a typical user can't access. Devices or creatures lacking computers, software, or cybernetics can't be hacked&mdash;for example, a person with no <a href="#cyberpunk-cybernetics">cyberware</a>, a candle, office chair, or toilet.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Generally, you need to make a hacking roll to remain undetected, and a defense roll to avoid a hack or counter-attack. Other rolls might be used to negate attempts to find or harm you.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Fast Talk (1 Intellect point):</strong> When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn't hostile, you convince that creature to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. Action. <span class="og-ref">(138)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Hacker (2 Intellect points):</strong> You gain quick access to a desired bit of information in a computer or similar device, or you access one of its primary functions. Action. <span class="og-ref">(147)</span></p></li>

Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Knowledge Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two areas of knowledge such as history, geography, archeology, and so on.

				<li><p><strong>Optical Hack (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You reboot the technological optical sensors of a target within short range (such as a robot, surveillance camera, or person with cybernetic optics). If your Intellect-based attack against them succeeds, the target is blinded for one round. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the range (long for one level of Effort, very long for two, or 1000 feet (300 m) for three).

				<li><p><strong>Overheat Hack (1 Intellect point):</strong> You overheat the electrical system of a creature (such as a robot or cyberware-equipped person) or electronic object (such as a computer or technological vehicle) within short range that you can see. If your Intellect-based attack succeeds against the creature, you inflict 3 points of fire damage. If the target is an object rather than a creature (such as a computer or vehicle), this attack is eased.

				<p>Scramble Machine is a <a href="#cyberpunk-hacking">hack</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Sensor Scan (2 Intellect points):</strong> You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area; the results of your scan are compared to a database of information (facial recognition, object recognition, police database, and so on) to determine what it is you're looking at. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the objects and creatures in that area. For example, you might learn that a device is made of metal, plastic, and electronics. You might learn a person's name, occupation, whether or not they have any standard cybernetics, and that they have several outstanding parking tickets. You might learn that the creature in front of you is an exotic mammal (such as a tapir), and that owning it requires an expensive permit. However, this ability doesn't tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don't know what the metal and plastic device does—it might be a radio or a land mine. In the second, you don't know the person is intent on harming you. In the third, you don't know if the creature is dangerous. The information you do get from the initial scan probably gives you enough of a lead to perform an internet search to find more information. Many materials (such as lead shielding, a Faraday cage, or concrete) prevent or hinder scanning. Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Spin Identity (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You convince all intelligent creatures who can see, hear, and understand you that you are someone or something other than who you actually are. You don't impersonate a specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you convince the victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain category of people. "We're from the government." "I'm just a simple farmer from the next town over." "Your commander sent me." A disguise isn't necessary, but a good disguise will almost certainly be an asset to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one creature, the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled creatures remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other circumstances reveal your true identity earlier. Action. <span class="og-ref">(185)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tech Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: crafting, computers, identifying, machines, piloting, repairing, or vehicle driving. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tinker (1 Intellect point):</strong> You make a device do something different from its original purpose. For example, a blaster becomes a bomb. A scanner becomes a signal booster for a radio transmitter. A music player becomes a battery for another device. The effective level of the modified device is 1 lower than normal, and the device is rendered unusable (for its original purpose) until repaired. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(192)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><span>&#9889;</span><strong>Translation App:</strong> You have adaptive learning software installed in your <a href="#cyberware-communicator-implant">communicator implant</a>. After hearing an unfamiliar human language spoken for a few minutes, the software deciphers the language and translates it for you, either directly into your ear or in your vision as holophone subtitles. If you choose, you can have the software translate what you say into this language, projecting it audibly from an implanted speaker. The software's translation improves the longer it can listen to a source language, picking up idioms and slang after a few hours. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 16)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Understanding (1 Intellect point):</strong> You observe or study a creature or object. Your next interaction with that creature or object gains one asset. Action. <span class="og-ref">(194)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Bonus Cypher App:</strong> You can bear one additional app cypher (your cypher limit increases by one, but only if the extra cypher is an app cypher). When you advance to a tier where you can select Expert Cypher Use, Adroit Cypher Use, or Master Cypher Use, you can replace this ability with the cypher ability you qualify for. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Calm Stranger (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You can cause one intelligent creature to remain calm as you speak. The creature doesn't need to speak your language, but it must be able to see you. It remains calm as long as you focus all your attention on it and it is not attacked or otherwise threatened. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to calm additional creatures allied with your initial target, one additional creature per level of Effort applied. Action. <span class="og-ref">(118)</span></p></li>

Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(129)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Distant Interface (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can activate, deactivate, or control a machine at long range as if you were next to it, even if normally you would have to touch or manually operate it. If you have never interacted with the particular machine before, the task is hindered by two steps. To use this ability, you must understand the function of the machine, it must be your size or smaller, and it can't be connected to another intelligence (or be intelligent itself).

				<li><p><strong>Gather Intelligence (2 Intellect points):</strong> When in a group of people (a caravan, a palace, a village, a city, <em>etc.</em>) you can ask around about any topic you choose and come away with useful information. You can ask a specific question, or you can simply obtain general facts. You also get a good idea of the general layout of the location involved, note the presence of all major sites, and perhaps even notice obscure details. For example, not only do you find out if anyone in the palace has seen the missing boy, but you also get a working knowledge of the layout of the palace itself, note all the entrances and which are used more often than others, and take notice that everyone seems to avoid the well in the eastern courtyard for some reason. Action to initiate, about an hour to complete. <span class="og-ref">(144)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Impart Ideal (3 Intellect points):</strong> After interacting for at least one minute with a creature who can hear and understand you, you can attempt to temporarily impart an ideal to it that you could not otherwise convince it to adopt. An ideal is different than a specific suggestion or command; an ideal is an overarching value such as "All life is sacred," "My political party is the best," "Children should be seen, not heard," and so on. An ideal influences a creature's behavior but doesn't control it. The imparted ideal lasts as long as befits the situation, but usually at least a few hours. The ideal is jeopardized if someone friendly to the creature spends a minute or more bringing it back to its senses. Action. <span class="og-ref">(151)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Machine Efficiency (3 Intellect points):</strong> You can make a blaster shoot farther, coax more speed from a skycycle, improve the clarity of a camera, jury-rig a light to be brighter, speed up a network connection, and so on. You increase an object's level by 2 for one minute, or you treat the object as an asset that eases an associated task by two steps for one minute (your choice). Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(159)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Practiced in Armor:</strong> You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1. You start the game with a type of armor of your choice. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(171)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Skill With Defense:</strong> Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(183)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Unexpected Betrayal:</strong> Within a round or two of successfully using Enthrall, Fast Talk, or a similar ability on a target within short range, the first attack you make on that target is eased by two steps. Once you use Unexpected Betrayal on a target, using your abilities or attempting simple persuasion on that target is permanently hindered by two steps.

				<li><p><strong>Adroit Cypher Use:</strong> You can bear four cyphers at a time. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Beckon Hack (3 Intellect points):</strong> You hack a foe's brain implant, tricking them into hearing or seeing something they think they need to investigate. They might interpret this as someone calling their name, an ally waving for them to approach, or a text message asking them to move to a specific location. If your Intellect-based roll against the creature is successful, on their next turn they move up to a short distance to where you indicated, without thinking anything is amiss. The foe must be within short range and able to understand you. The command can't inflict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so you can't make them step off of a roof or into a trash compactor. Once the creature moves to the designated location, they are free to act normally (depending on the circumstances, they might think they imagined or misheard the call, that someone is playing a trick on them, or there is something suspicious going on). The foe can still defend themselves normally and return an attack if one is made on them. Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 17)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Blend In (4 Intellect points):</strong> When you blend in, creatures still see you, but they attach no importance to your presence for about a minute. While blending in, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining period of effect by taking an action to focus on seeming innocuous and as if you belong. Action to initiate or reinitiate. <span class="og-ref">(113)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Expert Follower:</strong> You gain a level 3 <a href="#followers">follower</a>. They are not restricted on their modifications. You can take this ability multiple times, each time gaining another level 3 follower. Alternatively, you could choose to advance a level 2 follower you already have to level 3 and then gain a new level 2 follower. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(137)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Grand Deception (3 Intellect points):</strong> You convince an intelligent creature that can understand you and isn't hostile of something that is wildly and obviously untrue. Action. <span class="og-ref">(146)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Lead by Inquiry:</strong> You keep your allies on their toes with occasional questions, jokes, and even mock drills for those who care to join in. After spending 24 hours with you, your allies are treated as if trained in tasks related to perception. This benefit is ongoing while you remain in your allies' company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to the allies' company within 24 hours. If you leave the allies' company for more than 24 hours, you must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(157)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Mind Reading (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short range, even if the target doesn't want you to. You must be able to see your target. Once you have established contact, you can read the target's thoughts for up to one minute. If you also have the Mind Reading special ability from another source, you can use this ability at long range, and you don't need to be able to see the target (but you do have to know that the target is within range). Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(162)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Oratory (4 Intellect points):</strong> When speaking with a group of intelligent creatures that can understand you and aren't hostile, you convince them to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action should not put the creatures or their allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. Action. <span class="og-ref">(167)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Perfect Stranger (3 Intellect points):</strong> You alter your posture and way of speaking and make a small but real alteration to an outfit (such as putting on or taking off a hat, reversing a cloak, and so on). For the next hour (or as long as you keep up the alteration), even creatures that know you well don't recognize you. All tasks related to hiding your true identity during this period gain one free level of Effort. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(169)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Quick Wits:</strong> When performing a task that would normally require spending points from your Intellect Pool, you can spend points from your Speed Pool instead. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Spray (2 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow or submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. This ability uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). You are trained in making this attack. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal. You can also use this ability on multiple thrown weapons (stones, shuriken, daggers, and so on) if you're carrying them on your person or they are all within reach. Action. <span class="og-ref">(185)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Telling (2 Intellect points):</strong> This ability provides an asset to any tasks for attempting to deceive, persuade, or intimidate. Each use lasts up to a minute; a new use (to switch tasks) replaces the previous use. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(190)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Confounding Banter (4 Intellect points):</strong> You spew a stream of nonsense to distract a foe within immediate range.

				<li><p><strong>Feint (2 Speed points):</strong> If you use one action creating a misdirection or diversion, in the next round you can take advantage of your opponent's lowered defenses.

				<li><p><strong>Strategize (6 Intellect points):</strong> Having an action plan in place before facing a challenge improves the odds of success, even if that plan is eventually changed or discarded once it's put into play. If you and your allies spend at least ten minutes going over a plan of action, all of you gain one free level of Effort that can be applied to one task you attempt during the execution of that plan within the next 24 hours.

				<li><p><strong>Crowd Control (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You control the actions of up to five creatures in short range. This effect lasts for one minute. All targets must be level 2 or lower. Your control is limited to simple verbal commands like "Stop," "Run away," "Follow that guard," "Look over there," or "Get out of my way." All affected creatures respond to the command unless you specifically command them otherwise. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the targets or affect an additional five people. Thus, to control a group that has a level 4 target (two levels above the normal limit) or a group of fifteen people, you must apply two levels of Effort. When the Crowd Control ability ends, the creatures remember your commands but don't remember being controlled—your commands seemed reasonable at the time. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(123)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Inspiring Success (6 Intellect points):</strong> When you succeed on a roll to perform a task related to the stat that you choose upon selecting this ability, and you applied at least one level of Effort, you may choose another character within short range.

				<li><p><strong>Shatter Mind (7+ Intellect points):</strong> Your words reverberate destructively in the brain of an intelligent level 1 target within short range that can hear and understand you. They destroy tissue, memories, and personality, triggering a vegetative state. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target.

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Block (3 Speed points):</strong> You automatically block the next melee attack made against you within the next minute. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(115)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Danger Sense (1 Speed point):</strong> Your initiative task is eased. You pay the cost each time the ability is used. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(124)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong><span>&#9889;</span>Datajack (1 Intellect point):</strong> With computer access, you jack in instantly and learn a bit more about something you can see. You get an asset on a task involving that person or object. Action. <span class="og-ref">(124)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Any duration dealing with physical actions is either doubled or halved, whichever is better for you. For example, if the typical person can hold their breath for thirty seconds, you can hold it for one minute. If the typical person can march for four hours without stopping, you can do so for eight hours. In terms of harmful effects, if a poison paralyzes its victims for one minute, you are paralyzed for thirty seconds. The minimum duration is always one round. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(134)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Find the Way:</strong> When you apply Effort to a navigation task because you don't know the way, are lost, are attempting to blaze a new route, need to choose between two or more otherwise similar paths to take, or something very similar, you can apply a free level of Effort. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(140)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Fleet of Foot (1+ Speed points):</strong> You can move a short distance as part of another action. You can move a long distance as your entire action for a turn. If you apply a level of Effort to this ability, you can move a long distance and make an attack as your entire action for a turn, but the attack is hindered. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(141)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Hacker (2 Intellect points):</strong> You gain quick access to a desired bit of information in a computer or similar device, or you access one of its primary functions. Action. <span class="og-ref">(147)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Improved Edge:</strong> Choose one of your Edge stats that is 0. It increases to 1. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(151)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Knowledge Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two areas of knowledge such as history, geography, archeology, and so on. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(157)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Machine Interface (2 Intellect points):</strong> For one minute you gain an asset on tasks to discern the level, function, and activation of technological devices that you touch. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(159)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Muscles of Iron (2 Might points):</strong> For the next ten minutes, all Might-based actions other than attack rolls that you attempt are eased. If you already have this ability from another source, the effect of this ability lasts for one hour instead of ten minutes. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(165)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>No Need for Weapons:</strong> When you make an unarmed attack (such as a punch or kick), it counts as a medium weapon instead of a light weapon. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(166)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Optical Hack (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You reboot the technological optical sensors of a target within short range (such as a robot, surveillance camera, or person with cybernetic optics). If your Intellect-based attack against them succeeds, the target is blinded for one round. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the range (long for one level of Effort, very long for two, or 1000 feet (300 m) for three). Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Overheat Hack (1 Intellect point):</strong> You overheat the electrical system of a creature (such as a robot or cyberware-equipped person) or electronic object (such as a computer or technological vehicle) within short range that you can see. If your Intellect-based attack succeeds against the creature, you inflict 3 points of fire damage. If the target is an object rather than a creature (such as a computer or vehicle), this attack is eased. Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Practiced With All Weapons:</strong> You become practiced with light, medium, and heavy weapons and suffer no penalty when using any kind of weapon. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(171)</span></p></li>

			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p>Scramble Machine is a <a href="#cyberpunk-hacking">hack</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Physical Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: balancing, climbing, jumping, running, or swimming. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(170)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Practiced in Armor:</strong> You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1. You start the game with a type of armor of your choice. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(171)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Scramble Machine (2 Intellect points):</strong> You render one machine within short range unable to function for one round. Alternatively, you can hinder any action by the machine (or by someone attempting to use the machine) for one minute. Action. <span class="og-ref">(179)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Sensor Scan (2 Intellect points):</strong> You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area; the results of your scan are compared to a database of information (facial recognition, object recognition, police database, and so on) to determine what it is you're looking at. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the objects and creatures in that area. For example, you might learn that a device is made of metal, plastic, and electronics. You might learn a person's name, occupation, whether or not they have any standard cybernetics, and that they have several outstanding parking tickets. You might learn that the creature in front of you is an exotic mammal (such as a tapir), and that owning it requires an expensive permit. However, this ability doesn't tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don't know what the metal and plastic device does—it might be a radio or a land mine. In the second, you don't know the person is intent on harming you. In the third, you don't know if the creature is dangerous. The information you do get from the initial scan probably gives you enough of a lead to perform an internet search to find more information. Many materials (such as lead shielding, a Faraday cage, or concrete) prevent or hinder scanning. Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Surging Confidence (1 Might point):</strong> When you use an action to make your first recovery roll of the day, you immediately gain another action. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(188)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tech Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: crafting, computers, identifying, machines, piloting, repairing, or vehicle driving. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tinker (1 Intellect point):</strong> You make a device do something different from its original purpose. For example, a blaster becomes a bomb. A scanner becomes a signal booster for a radio transmitter. A music player becomes a battery for another device. The effective level of the modified device is 1 lower than normal, and the device is rendered unusable (for its original purpose) until repaired. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(192)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Trained Without Armor:</strong> You are trained in Speed defense tasks when not wearing armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong><span>&#9889;</span>Armored Chrome:</strong> You have +1 to Armor if you do not wear physical armor. You can only select this ability if you have at least three significant pieces of cyberware that (at the GM's discretion) are durable enough to provide some protection from attacks. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Bonus Cypher App:</strong> You can bear one additional app cypher (your cypher limit increases by one, but only if the extra cypher is an app cypher). When you advance to a tier where you can select Expert Cypher Use, Adroit Cypher Use, or Master Cypher Use, you can replace this ability with the cypher ability you qualify for. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Curious:</strong> You're always curious about your surroundings, even on a subconscious level. Whenever you use Effort to attempt navigation, perception, or initiative tasks in an area that you've only rarely or never visited before, you can apply an additional free level of Effort. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(123)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Danger Instinct (3 Speed points):</strong> If you are attacked by surprise, whether by a creature, a device, or simply an environmental hazard (a tree falling on you), you can move an immediate distance before the attack occurs. If moving prevents the attack, you are safe. If the attack can still potentially affect you&mdash;if the attacking creature can move to keep pace, if the attack fills an area too big to escape, etc. &mdash;the ability offers no benefit. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(124)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Distant Interface (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can activate, deactivate, or control a machine at long range as if you were next to it, even if normally you would have to touch or manually operate it. If you have never interacted with the particular machine before, the task is hindered by two steps. To use this ability, you must understand the function of the machine, it must be your size or smaller, and it can't be connected to another intelligence (or be intelligent itself).

			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Enable Others:</strong> You can use the helping rules to provide a benefit to another character attempting a physical task. Unlike the normal helping rules, this doesn't require you to use your action helping the other character with the task. This requires no action on your part. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(133)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Escape (2 Speed points):</strong> You slip your restraints, squeeze through the bars, break the grip of a creature holding you, pull free from sucking quicksand, or otherwise get loose from whatever is holding you in place. Action. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Eye for Detail (2 Intellect points):</strong> When you spend five minutes or so thoroughly exploring an area no larger than a short distance in diameter, you can ask the GM one question about the area. The GM must answer you truthfully. You cannot use this more than one time per area per 24 hours. Action to initiate, five minutes to complete. <span class="og-ref">(138)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Foil Danger (2 Intellect points):</strong> You negate one source of potential danger related to one creature or object that you are aware of within immediate distance for one round. This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a trap triggered by a pressure plate, or a creature's natural ability (something special, innate, and dangerous, like a dragon's fiery breath or a giant cobra's venom). You can also try to foil a foe's mundane action (such as an attack with a weapon or claw), so that the action isn't made this round. Make your roll against the level of the attack, danger, or creature. Action. <span class="og-ref">(142)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Hand to Eye (2 Speed points):</strong> This ability provides an asset to any tasks involving manual dexterity, such as pickpocketing, lockpicking, games involving agility, and so on. Each use lasts up to a minute; a new use (to switch tasks) replaces the previous use. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(148)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Investigative Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: perception, identifying, lockpicking, assessing danger, or tinkering with devices. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Machine Efficiency (3 Intellect points):</strong> You can make a blaster shoot farther, coax more speed from a skycycle, improve the clarity of a camera, jury-rig a light to be brighter, speed up a network connection, and so on. You increase an object's level by 2 for one minute, or you treat the object as an asset that eases an associated task by two steps for one minute (your choice). Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(159)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Quick Recovery:</strong> Your second recovery roll (usually requiring ten minutes) is only a single action. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(173)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Range Increase:</strong> Ranges for you increase by one step. Immediate becomes short, short becomes long, long becomes very long, and very long becomes 1,000 feet (300 m). Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Skill With Defense:</strong> Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(183)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Stand Watch (2 Intellect points):</strong> While standing watch (mostly remaining in place for an extended period of time), you unfailingly remain awake and alert for up to eight hours. During this time, you are trained in perception tasks as well as stealth tasks to conceal yourself from those who might approach. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(186)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Travel Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: navigation, riding, running, piloting, or vehicle driving. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Wreck:</strong> Using two hands, you wield a weapon or a tool with a powerful swing. (If fighting unarmed, this attack is made with both fists or both feet together.) When using this as an attack, you take a &minus;1 penalty to the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of damage. When attempting to damage an object or barrier, you are trained in the task. Action. <span class="og-ref">(200)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Controlled Fall:</strong> When you fall while you are able to use actions and within reach of a vertical surface, you can attempt to slow your fall. Make a Speed roll with a difficulty of 1 for every 20 feet (6 m) you fall. On a success, you take half damage from the fall. If you reduce the difficulty to 0, you take no damage. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(122)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Experienced in Armor:</strong> The cost reduction from your Practiced in Armor ability improves. You now reduce the Speed cost by 2. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Expert Cypher Use:</strong> You can bear three cyphers at a time. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(137)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Ignore the Pain:</strong> You ignore the impaired condition and treat the debilitated condition as impaired. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(150)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Obstacle Running (3 Speed points):</strong> For the next minute, you can ignore obstacles that slow your movement, allowing you to travel at normal speed through areas with rubble, fences, tables, and similar objects that you would have to climb over or move around. This movement might include sliding on a railing, briefly running along a wall, or even stepping on a creature to boost yourself over something. If an obstacle would normally require a Might or Speed task to overcome, such as swinging on a rope, balancing on a rope, or jumping over a hole, you are trained in that task. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(167)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Seize the Moment (4+ Speed points):</strong> If you succeed on a Speed defense roll to resist an attack, you gain an action.

Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(183)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Spray (2 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow or submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. This ability uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). You are trained in making this attack. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal. You can also use this ability on multiple thrown weapons (stones, shuriken, daggers, and so on) if you're carrying them on your person or they are all within reach. Action. <span class="og-ref">(185)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Think Your Way Out:</strong> When you wish it, you can use points from your Intellect Pool rather than your Might Pool or Speed Pool on any noncombat action. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(191)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Trapfinder (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You find any traps (like a floor that would give way beneath you) or mechanical triggers to a trap or defense system that might pose a threat. You can do this without setting them off and in lieu of making a roll to find them. This ability can find traps of level 4 or below. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of traps that can be found by 2, so using two levels of Effort can find all traps of level 8 or below. Action. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Wrest From Chance:</strong> If you roll a natural 1 on a d20, you can reroll the die. If you reroll, you avoid a <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a>&mdash;unless you roll a second 1&mdash;and might succeed on your task.

			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Bash (1 Might point):</strong> This is a pummeling melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal, but dazes your target for one round, during which time all tasks it performs are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><span>&#9889;</span><strong>Datajack (1 Intellect point):</strong> With computer access, you jack in instantly and learn a bit more about something you can see. You get an asset on a task involving that person or object. Action. <span class="og-ref">(124)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Hacker (2 Intellect points):</strong> You gain quick access to a desired bit of information in a computer or similar device, or you access one of its primary functions. Action. <span class="og-ref">(147)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Optical Hack (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You reboot the technological optical sensors of a target within short range (such as a robot, surveillance camera, or person with cybernetic optics). If your Intellect-based attack against them succeeds, the target is blinded for one round. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the range (long for one level of Effort, very long for two, or 1000 feet (300 m) for three). Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Overheat Hack (1 Intellect point):</strong> You overheat the electrical system of a creature (such as a robot or cyberware-equipped person) or electronic object (such as a computer or technological vehicle) within short range that you can see. If your Intellect-based attack succeeds against the creature, you inflict 3 points of fire damage. If the target is an object rather than a creature (such as a computer or vehicle), this attack is eased. Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Overwatch (1 Intellect point):</strong> You use a ranged weapon to target a limited area (such as a doorway, a hallway, or the eastern side of the clearing) and make an attack against the next viable target to enter that area. This works like a wait action, but you also negate any benefit the target would have from cover, position, surprise, range, illumination, or visibility. Further, you inflict 1 additional point of damage with the attack. You can remain on overwatch as long as you wish, within reason. Action. <span class="og-ref">(168)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Physical Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: balancing, climbing, jumping, running, or swimming. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(170)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Scramble Machine (2 Intellect points):</strong> You render one machine within short range unable to function for one round.

				<li><p><strong>Sensor Scan (2 Intellect points):</strong> You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area; the results of your scan are compared to a database of information (facial recognition, object recognition, police database, and so on) to determine what it is you're looking at. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the objects and creatures in that area. For example, you might learn that a device is made of metal, plastic, and electronics. You might learn a person's name, occupation, whether or not they have any standard cybernetics, and that they have several outstanding parking tickets. You might learn that the creature in front of you is an exotic mammal (such as a tapir), and that owning it requires an expensive permit. However, this ability doesn't tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don't know what the metal and plastic device does—it might be a radio or a land mine. In the second, you don't know the person is intent on harming you. In the third, you don't know if the creature is dangerous. The information you do get from the initial scan probably gives you enough of a lead to perform an internet search to find more information. Many materials (such as lead shielding, a Faraday cage, or concrete) prevent or hinder scanning. Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Swipe (1 Speed point):</strong> This is a quick, agile melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal but dazes your target for one round, during which time all tasks it performs are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(188)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tech Skills:</strong> You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: crafting, computers, identifying, machines, piloting, repairing, or vehicle driving. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tinker (1 Intellect point):</strong> You make a device do something different from its original purpose. For example, a blaster becomes a bomb. A scanner becomes a signal booster for a radio transmitter. A music player becomes a battery for another device. The effective level of the modified device is 1 lower than normal, and the device is rendered unusable (for its original purpose) until repaired. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(192)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Trained Without Armor:</strong> You are trained in Speed defense tasks when not wearing armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Energy Resistance:</strong> Choose a discrete type of energy that you have experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You gain +5 to Armor against damage from that type of energy. You must be familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience with a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you can't protect against it.

				<li><p><strong>Spray (2 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow or submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. This ability uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). You are trained in making this attack.

The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the objects and creatures in that area. For example, you might learn that a device is made of metal, plastic, and electronics. You might learn a person's name, occupation, whether or not they have any standard cybernetics, and that they have several outstanding parking tickets. You might learn that the creature in front of you is an exotic mammal (such as a tapir), and that owning it requires an expensive permit. However, this ability doesn't tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don't know what the metal and plastic device does—it might be a radio or a land mine. In the second, you don't know the person is intent on harming you. In the third, you don't know if the creature is dangerous. The information you do get from the initial scan probably gives you enough of a lead to perform an internet search to find more information. Many materials (such as lead shielding, a Faraday cage, or concrete) prevent or hinder scanning. Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 11)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Corpse Datadump (3 Intellect points):</strong> You touch the remains of a recently killed creature and make an Intellect-based roll to read data from its brain <a href="#cyberpunk-cybernetics">cybernetics</a>. The GM sets the difficulty based on the amount of time that has passed since the creature died. A creature that has been dead for only a few minutes is a difficulty 2 task, one that has been dead for an hour is a difficulty 4 task, and one that has been dead for a few days is a difficulty 9 task. If you succeed, you can browse the corpse's memories in a virtual environment as if you were speaking to its living self. This lasts about one minute, after which time the environment degrades. The creature is limited to what it knew in life, though it cannot recall minor memories, only big events of importance to it.

				<li><p><strong>Beckon Hack (3 Intellect points):</strong> You hack a foe's brain implant, tricking them into hearing or seeing something they think they need to investigate. They might interpret this as someone calling their name, an ally waving for them to approach, or a text message asking them to move to a specific location. If your Intellect-based roll against the creature is successful, on their next turn they move up to a short distance to where you indicated, without thinking anything is amiss. The foe must be within short range and able to understand you. The command can't inflict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so you can't make them step off of a roof or into a trash compactor. Once the creature moves to the designated location, they are free to act normally (depending on the circumstances, they might think they imagined or misheard the call, that someone is playing a trick on them, or there is something suspicious going on).

				<li><p><strong>Spray (2 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow or submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting. This ability uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). You are trained in making this attack.

				<li><p><strong>Death Touch (6 Intellect points):</strong> You gather disrupting energy in your fingertip and touch a creature. If the target is an NPC or a creature of level 3 or lower, it dies. If the target is a PC of any tier, they move down one step on the damage track. Action. <span class="og-ref">(125)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Limited Camouflage (3 Speed points):</strong> You activate camouflage software that alters your appearance to match an adjacent large object such as a wall, cabinet, or vehicle. Everyone who was observing you completely loses track of you. Although you're not invisible, you can't be seen until you reveal yourself again by making an attack or moving away from the object. Action. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 19)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Multiple Skills:</strong> You are trained in three skills of your choice in which you are not already trained. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose three different skills. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(165)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Peaceblock Hack (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You hack a foe's brain implant, triggering pain whenever they attempt to harm a creature you specify. The foe must be level 3 or lower and within short range. For the next minute, the foe's harmful actions against the designated creature are hindered by two steps, and the foe automatically take 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) every time they try to touch, strike, or harm the designated creature. The foe immediately recognizes (without needing to attack first) that acting against the creature will be harmful. The foe knows when the effect ends, remembers the earlier aversion, and can immediately act normally.</p><p>In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to peaceblock a level 6 target (three levels above the normal limit) or block them for four minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must apply three levels of Effort.</p><p>Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(NR, 17)</span><span class="og-ref">(NR, 19)</span><span class="og-ability-notes">(See ability details)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Projection (4 Intellect points):</strong> You project an image of yourself to any location you have seen or previously visited. Distance does not matter as long as the location is on the same world as you. The projection copies your appearance, movements, and any sounds you make for the next ten minutes. Anyone present at the location can see and hear you as if you were there. However, you do not perceive through your projection. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(172)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Robot Fighter:</strong> When fighting a robot or intelligent machine, you are trained in attacks and defense. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(178)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Task Specialization:</strong> Choose one task (other than attacks or defense) that you are trained in. You become specialized in that task.

The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible.

You can order any item you choose that would ordinarily have a crafting difficulty of 5 or lower and costs up to $1,000.

You can attempt to perceive the sound even if interceding barriers block it or the sound is very slight, though this requires a few additional rounds of concentration. To discriminate the sound you wish in a noisy environment might also require a few additional rounds of concentration as you audibly explore the surrounding soundscape.

				<li><p><strong>Question the Network (5 Intellect points):</strong> You send a digital query to any or all machines within 1 mile (1.5 km). Depending on the circumstances, this might be a wireless communication or transmitted through a hard data connection. You can ask one basic question about the machines or anything happening near them and receive a simple answer.

				<li><p><strong>SHITS Hack (7 Intellect points):</strong> A foe within short range temporarily experiences SHITS and spends its next turn attacking the nearest creature (if multiple creatures are the same distance away, you can choose which one they attack). As long as you continue to use your action each turn to maintain this berserk state in the target, they continue to attack the nearest creature (switching to a new creature if their current target drops).

				<li><p><strong>Total Awareness:</strong> You possess such a high level of awareness that it's very difficult to surprise, hide from, or sneak up on you.

			<p>Focus is what makes you unique. No two PCs in a group should have the same focus.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Additionally, not all foci are appropriate for every genre. The GM might decide which foci are available&mdash;or not available&mdash;in the setting. Appropriate foci are important, because a focus like <a href="#focus-commands-mental-powers">Commands Mental Powers</a> makes it clear that psychic abilities exist in the setting. <a href="#focus-howls-at-the-moon">Howls at the Moon</a> implies the existence of bestial transformations, and <a href="#focus-pilots-starcraft">Pilots Starcraft</a> requires available starships&mdash;or equivalent&mdash;to pilot.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">At tier 1, your focus gives a you at least one <a href="#ability">special ability</a>&mdash;which might be anything from a signature kind of <a href="#attack">attack</a>, improving your ability to <a href="#move">move</a> or <a href="#defend">defend</a> yourself, training in special <a href="#skill">skills</a>&mdash;whatever is foundational to the concept of the focus. A few provide <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> important to the focus.</p>
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="choose-focus-connection">Choosing a Focus Connection</h5>
			<p>Choosing a <a href="#focus-connections">focus connection</a> builds your story, usually involving one of the other PCs&mdash;it might reflect a part of your collective history, establish interesting dynamic you can carry forward into the game, or create unique interactions in the game mechanics between you.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p><strong>Focus Origins:</strong> Think about your focus in relationship to your <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>, your <a href="#type">type</a>, and the setting. A focus like <a href="#focus-rides-the-lightning">Rides the Lightning</a> gives you awesome abilities. Is your power a feature of your unique biology, a cybernetic implant that keeps you alive, or a gift from the god of lightning? When you use your abilities, what does it look, sound, and feel like?</p>

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="type-swap-option">Type Swap Option</h5>
			<p>A few foci provide a "type swap option". These options you to choose to exchange one of the <a href="#ability">special abilities</a> you can choose from your <a href="#type">type</a> for the indicated ability instead.</p>
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="focus-abilities">Gaining New Focus Abilities</h5>
			<p>Each time you reach a new tier through <a href="#advancement">character advancement</a>, your focus grants you at least one new ability. Focus abilities are cumulative, and sometimes your new focus ability will improve or enhance an ability you have already gained from your focus.</p>
			<h5 class="og-h-small" id="ability-choice">Ability Choice</h5>
			<p>At certain tiers, your focus offers you a choice of one of two abilities. The GM might allow you to purchase an ability you didn't choose by spending 4 <a href="#xp">XP</a> as a character advancement.</p>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p>Ability choices are most common at tier 3 and 6, but a few foci&mdash;like <a href="#focus-never-says-die">Never Says Die</a>&mdash;include an ability choice at other tiers.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Golem Body:</strong> You gain +1 to Armor, +1 to your Might Edge, and 5 additional points to your Might Pool. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe (though you do need rest and sleep). You move more stiffly than a creature of flesh, which means you can never be trained or specialized in Speed defense rolls. Furthermore, you are practiced in using your stone fists as a medium weapon. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(145)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Golem Healing:</strong> Your stone form from the Golem Body ability is more difficult to repair than flesh, which means you are unable to use the first, single-action recovery roll of the day that other PCs have access to. Thus, your first recovery roll on any given day requires ten minutes of rest, the second requires an hour of rest, and the third requires ten hours.

				<li><p><strong>Golem Grip (3 Might points):</strong> Your attack with the stone fists from your Golem Body ability is eased. If you hit, you can grab the target, preventing it from moving on its next turn. While you hold the target, its attacks or attempts to break free are hindered. If the target attempts to break free instead of attacking, you must make a Might-based roll to maintain your grip. If the target fails to break free, you can continue to hold it each round as your subsequent actions, automatically inflicting 4 points of damage each round by squeezing.

During this time, you lose all mobility as well as the ability to take physical actions. You cannot sense what's happening around you, and no time seems to pass for you. While Still As a Statue, you gain +10 to Armor against damage of all sorts. Under normal circumstances, you automatically rouse to normal wakefulness and mobility a day later.

This ability does not change how many points of energy you can store. If you also have Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can absorb 2 points of damage from other energy sources as well. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(108)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy:</strong> When you use Absorb Kinetic Energy, instead of being able to absorb 1 point of damage from a physical attack or impact, you can absorb 2 points.

They can also act logically (such as reacting appropriately to fire or attacks) when you aren't directly observing them. The illusion includes sound and smell.

The creature must be within short range and able to understand you. The command can't inflict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so "Commit suicide" won't work, but "Flee" might. In addition, the command can require the creature to take only one action, so "Unlock the door" might work, but "Unlock the door and run through it" won't. A commanded creature can still defend itself normally and return an attack if one is made on it. If you possess another ability that allows you to command a creature, you can target two creatures at once as your base effect if you use either ability. Action. <span class="og-ref">(120)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Lightning Flash (4+ Intellect points):</strong> Lightning strikes within long range, filling an immediate area and inflicting 3 points of damage on all affected creatures. Effort applied to one attack counts for all attacks against targets in the area of the flash. Even on an unsuccessful attack, a creature in the area still takes 1 point of damage. Your attack is eased against targets wearing, carrying, or made of a significant amount of metal. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 50)</span></p></li>

Depending on the barrier, this might involve finding a weak spot you can push through, pressing the right button by luck, just breaking through, or even weirder explanations like touching a thin place between dimensions or an unexpected interaction with your equipment. The difficulty of the task is the level of the barrier. This ability allows you alone to pass through, not anyone else, and the way through closes at the end of your turn (which might mean you're trapped on the far side).

				<li><p><strong>Petrify (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You slowly transform a creature within short range into lifeless stone. The target must be level 2 or lower. If your attack succeeds, the creature takes 6 points of damage and moves one step down the damage track as their flesh begins to mineralize. If the transformation is not interrupted by the end of your next turn, the creature fully becomes a harmless stone statue. You can cast this spell to restore a petrified target back into their living self. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target.

				<li><p><strong>Summon Demon (7+ Intellect points):</strong> A demon appears within immediate range.

			<p>The moon is a powerful force on the world, in terms of both science and magic. She hangs overhead like a watchful eye, makes creatures act strangely, represents cycles of time, and causes the ebb and flow of the tides. To you, she is a friend, an inspiration, and a constant reminder that someone is watching over you. You wield her magic to create beams of dangerous light, influence others, travel, and sense the underlying truth and reality of things. The day is not your foe (after all, the moon is often visible during the day), but you prefer the night when the moon can be the brightest light in the sky. You might call yourself a moonchild or a moon witch. You probably prefer black, white, or grey clothing, with flowing portions such as long sleeves, a cape, or a long coat. You might have one or more tattoos or tokens representing the moon, either full, crescent, or in multiple phases. Your favorite jewelry and adornments (like buttons) usually have moonstones.</p>

If you succeed, you gain that subtle cypher (the cypher's level is 6); if you fail, you get a random subtle cypher. If you aren't sure what specific subtle cypher you want, you can ask for a broad category such as "healing," "movement," or "skill"; this eases the magical lore task, and if you succeed, the GM chooses a random cypher that fits that category.

			<p class="og-ind">If you were around before the end, you could have been a soldier, mercenary, or at least someone who had basic survival training. What sets you apart from all the others like you is that you decided to hope when everything looked darkest.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">Since then, you have eaten your share of spoiled food and irradiated water, and survived. Whether that's because you've adapted, you're luckier, or you were just tougher than the rest is anyone's guess. But you're still walking the wastes even though so many others are gone.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">You probably don't spend a lot of time on your appearance, given that you wear the cobbled-together clothing and bits and pieces of armor you're able to scavenge from the ruins. Appearance doesn't matter; actions do.</p>

It also sets up the potential for future arcs, such as <a href="#arc-redemption">Redemption</a>. It's important that this involve actions you take. For example, you fall into substance abuse.

			<p>Willingly or unwillingly, you are going to change. This is another meta arc. It's less about a goal and more about character development.

			<p>You want to invent a new device, process, spell, or something similar. A cure for a heretofore unknown disease? An invocation with a result you've never heard of before? A method for getting into an impregnable vault? Any of these and more could be your discovery. While similar to the <a href="#arc-creation">Creation</a> arc and the <a href="#arc-learn">Learn</a> arc, the New Discovery arc involves blazing a new trail. No one can teach you what you want to know. You've got to do it on your own.</p>

			<p>If you choose this arc, you are hoping to create a strong support system among your friends and fellow travelers. You seek the assistance of those around you to help you through difficult times and you wish to offer assistance back. This connection might be to your fellow PCs, to a group of NPCs that you meet along the way, or as part of an already-established group or organization.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Opening:</strong> Let's Be Friends. You propose the idea of a support system to those you'd like to include.</p></li>

			<p>You raise a child to adulthood. It can be your biological child or one you adopt. It can even be a child taken under your wing, more a young protégé than a son or daughter. This is obviously a very long-term arc.</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Opening:</strong> Sharing Your Home. The child now lives with you.</p></li>

			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">

Unlike the <a href="#arc-avenge">Avenge</a> arc, this arc probably isn't about tracking down a murderer, but it might involve pursuing someone who stole from you, hurt you, or otherwise brought you grief.

			<p>Different from the <a href="#arc-learn">Learn</a> arc and the <a href="#arc-uncover-a-secret">Uncover a Secret</a> arc, this arc is about solving a crime or a similar action committed in the fairly recent past. It's not about practice or study, but about questions and answers. In theory, the mystery doesn't have to be a crime. It might be "Why is this strange caustic substance leaking into my basement?"
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Opening:</strong> Pledging to Solve the Mystery.</p></li>

			<p>Much like <a href="#arc-fall-from-grace">Fall From Grace</a>, Take the Wrong Path isn't typically an arc that a character intentionally desires. It's something the player chooses on a meta level for the character because it makes for an interesting story and sets up possible future arcs, such as Put Down Roots. In this case, perhaps the character manages their anxiety by drinking too much, becoming isolated, or starting too many fights. Perhaps they attempt to deal with grief by overeating (or undereating), by pushing away loved ones, or by becoming intimate with others without regard for their safety.</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Opening:</strong> The Fork. You take the first steps down the wrong path, even if you don't know it yet.</p></li>

			<p class="og-ind">This is different from the <a href="#arc-justice">Justice</a> arc because this isn't about justice (or even revenge)&ndash;it's about literally undoing something bad that happened in the past, such as a great library being burned to the ground, a sovereign people being driven from their land, and so on.</p>

				<h5 class="og-h-small" id="flavor-personalized">Creating a Personalized Flavor</h5>
				<p>Maybe you already know the name of the type you are creating for and just need to match it with the right flavor, but none of the listed options work. The GM might allow you to personalize your PC by allowing you to exchange <a href="#type">type</a> abilities for something else. When doing so, it's best to consult <a href="index.html#chapter-9-abilities">Chapter 9: Abilities</a> in the <a class="og-icon og-mcg" href="https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/">Cypher System Rulebook</a> or OG-CSRD.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
					<li><p><strong>Gaining a Flavor:</strong> You might be able to earn a personalized flavor by completing a character arc like <a href="#arc-join-an-organization">Join an Organization</a>, <a href="#arc-master-a-skill">Master a Skill</a>, <a href="#arc-mysterious-background">Mysterious Background</a>, or <a href="#arc-transformation">Transformation</a>, or purchase a flavor by spending 4 XP as a long-term benefit or character advancement.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Adding Flavor Abilities:</strong> When you gain a flavor or advance to a new tier, you and the GM should work together to create a list of <a href="#ability">special abilities</a> appropriate for your tier. If you gained your flavor after reaching tier 2, the GM might allow you to make a few additional exchanges of type abilities.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Approving Flavor Abilities:</strong> The GM approves each ability to ensure it is of appropriate tier, it is appropriate to the game's scope and setting, and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;that it won't cause another PC's focus or special abilities to feel redundant or be disruptive in the game.</p></li>

	<p>Creating illusions and affecting minds are sometimes considered "soft" magical disciplines (as opposed to "hard" disciplines that manipulate energy or physical matter). It's common for a character with an interest in one to learn a few spells in the other.</p>

				<li><p><strong>Background Music (1+ Intellect points):</strong> You create quiet background music in a short area, loud enough to be heard in a room with normal conversation, but not so loud to be distracting or overwhelming. The music repeats through up to ten songs you know, lasting up to an hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; each level of Effort adds one hour to the play time and five songs to the playlist. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 65, 70)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Fast Talk (1 Intellect point):</strong> When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn't hostile, you convince that creature to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. Action. <span class="og-ref">(138)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Goad (1 Intellect point):</strong> You can attempt to goad a target into a belligerent&mdash;and probably foolish&mdash;reaction that requires the target to try to close the distance between you and attempt to physically strike you on its next turn. They attempt this action even if this would cause them to break formation or to give up cover or a tactically superior position. Whether the target strikes you or fails to do so, they come to their senses immediately afterward, after which further tasks attempting to goad the target again are hindered.

				<li><p><strong>Impart Ideal (3 Intellect points):</strong> After interacting for at least one minute with a creature who can hear and understand you, you can attempt to temporarily impart an ideal to it that you could not otherwise convince it to adopt. An ideal is different than a specific suggestion or command; an ideal is an overarching value such as "All life is sacred," "My political party is the best," "Children should be seen, not heard," and so on. An ideal influences a creature's behavior but doesn't control it. The imparted ideal lasts as long as befits the situation, but usually at least a few hours. The ideal is jeopardized if someone friendly to the creature spends a minute or more bringing it back to its senses. Action. <span class="og-ref">(151)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Mental Link (1+ Intellect point):</strong> You open a pathway to another creature's mind via a light touch, which allows you to transmit thoughts and images to each other. The mental link remains regardless of distance and lasts for one hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to extend the duration by one hour for each level of Effort applied. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(161)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Minor Illusion (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create a single image of a creature or object within immediate range. The image must fit within a 10-foot (3 m) cube. The image can move (for example, you could make the illusion of a person walk or attack), but it can't leave the area defined by the cube. The illusion includes sound but not smell. It lasts for ten minutes, but if you want to change the original illusion significantly&mdash;such as making a creature appear to be wounded&mdash;you must concentrate on it again (though doing so doesn't cost additional Intellect points). If you move beyond immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes. Action to create; action to modify. <span class="og-ref">(162)</span></p></li>

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to calm additional creatures allied with your initial target, one additional creature per level of Effort applied. Action. <span class="og-ref">(118)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Cloud Personal Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> If you interact with or study a target for at least a round, you gain a sense of how its mind works, which you can use against it in the most blunt fashion possible. You can attempt to confuse it and make it forget what's just happened. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory.

The image can move (for example, you could make it walk or attack), but it can't move more than an immediate distance from where you created it. The illusion includes sound and smell. It lasts for ten minutes and changes as you direct (no concentration is needed). If you move beyond short range of the illusion, it vanishes. Action to create. <span class="og-ref">(150)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Misdirect Blame (2+ Intellect points):</strong> Using your clever words and knowledge of others, you can attempt to alter the narrative so that a target of up to level 3 within short range becomes uncertain of its conviction in one simple area, such as their conviction that you just stole a fruit from their stand or their belief that they've never met you before. This effect usually lasts only for the period of time you spend speaking, and perhaps up to a minute longer, before the target realizes its error. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the target level that can be affected. Afterward, all your tasks to persuade or otherwise socially interact with the target are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(163)</span></p></li>

The GM has final say over what counts as a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of deception is at work, you should know whether you can affect a creature before you attempt to use this ability on it.

Once you have established control, you maintain mental contact with the target and sense what it senses. You can allow it to act freely or override its control on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to control the mind of a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit) or control a target for four minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must apply three levels of Effort.

This is for difficult or strange things beyond those readily identified by using the appropriate knowledge or technical skill. Action. <span class="og-ref">(128)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Question Past Self (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You reach into the past up to a week and mentally ask your past self one or two questions about something you knew or observed at the chosen time. For example, if you've forgotten an important phone number or can't remember if a particular person was in a meeting, you can ask your past self about it while it's still fresh in your past self 's memory. Your past self doesn't perceive this as an intrusive voice&mdash;it just seems like an unexpected moment of reflection about the questions your present self asks. This doesn't allow you to remember things your past self didn't actually know at the time, but it can sometimes help your present self (in the form of an asset) learn more about or realize something your past self wasn't really paying attention to at the time (such as seeing part of a password or noting whether there was a red delivery truck nearby). For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can reach an additional week further into the past. Action. <span class="og-ref">(173)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Retrieve Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> You touch the remains of a recently killed creature and make an Intellect-based roll to restore its mind to life long enough to learn information from it. The GM sets the difficulty based on the amount of time that has passed since the creature died. A creature that has been dead for only a few minutes is a difficulty 2 task, one that has been dead for an hour is a difficulty 4 task, and one that has been dead for a few days is a difficulty 9 task. If you succeed, you awaken the corpse, causing its head to animate and perceive things as if it were alive. This enables communication for about one minute, which is how long it takes for the creature to realize that it's dead. The creature is limited to what it knew in life, though it cannot recall minor memories, only big events of importance to it. When the effect ends, or if you fail the roll, the creature's brain dissolves to mush and cannot be awakened again. Action. <span class="og-ref">(177)</span></p></li>

	<p>Characters who live in a modern world with magic and technology often know a bit about mixing the two of them together. These characters usually pick up a few useful spells (such as disrupting hostile magic or disabling a mugger's pistol) from various sources, much like how people tend to learn skills unrelated to their day job (like cooking, dancing, and playing guitar).</p>

			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Annoy Electronics (1 Intellect point):</strong> You interfere with the operations of an electronic device. The device must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Your interference is limited to things you could do in a few seconds if you were directly using the device. For example, you could make a person's phone start playing a loud video, type one or two commands on a computer's keyboard, hit a bunch of buttons in an elevator, or change the station or volume on a television screen. You must succeed at an Intellect-based task against the device or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you have never interacted with the particular device before, the task is hindered by two steps. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 74)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Arcanaphone (2 Intellect points):</strong> You make use of your cellular service to start a telephone call or use text messaging, lasting up to ten minutes. To anyone watching you, you look like you're in "hands free" mode. In all respects, this works as if you were carrying your device with you and using it directly (meaning the network notes your current location as if you were carrying your phone, and you may not have coverage in some areas). The first time you use this ability with your mobile service, you must contact their customer service department to authorize the magic (taking ten to sixty minutes), as if it were a new device. You can't use this ability if you don't have a cellular account. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 74)</span></p></li>

			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Enhance Athletics (2 Intellect points):</strong> You enhance the ability of one creature to perform certain athletic sports tasks. The creature must be within long range and visible to you. For the next minute, the creature can apply one free level of Effort to any one task to catch, hit, kick, or throw an object, or to any one climbing, jumping, or running task. Once this free level of Effort is used, the magic ends. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 74)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Mage Clock:</strong> You can mentally connect to a universal magical clock, allowing you to know the local time, down to a tenth of a second. You can have up to three magical timers at once, each of which sounds a mental alarm after an amount of time you specify or at a specific time (such as nine minutes from now, three hours from now, or 8 o'clock in the morning). Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 74)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Spellpay (1 Intellect point):</strong> You initiate a transaction with another person or business cashier within short range, giving them an amount of money that you specify. The currency comes from cash in your possession, money in your account, or a mix of both; the recipient receives this money in the same form as it came from you. For example, if you send someone $150, $50 of which is cash in your wallet and $100 of which comes from your bank account, they suddenly have $50 cash on hand and $100 in their bank account. Instead of a transaction between two people, you can instead use this ability to access your account, withdrawing or depositing cash as if using a teller machine. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 74)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Charm Machine (2 Intellect points):</strong> You convince an unintelligent machine to "like" you. A machine that likes you is 50 percent less likely to function if said function would cause you harm. Thus, if a foe attempts to detonate a bomb near you controlled by a detonator that likes you, there is a 50 percent chance that it won't explode. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(119)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Dispel Magic (2+ Intellect points):</strong> Choose one magical effect within long range. An effect of up to level 3 ends if you succeed on an Intellect-based attack roll against the level of the effect, or against the level of the creature or object the magical effect affects, whichever is higher. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can apply Effort to increase the level of the effect that can potentially be dispelled. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 75)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Gun Jammer (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You can interfere with a firearm so the next time it is used, it jams or misfires. The weapon must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Make an Intellect-based attack against the weapon or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you succeed, the next attack with the firearm fails, and the weapon won't fire until someone uses an action to correct the problem. If you activate this ability when it isn't your turn, your attack against the weapon is hindered. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more firearms; each level of Effort affects one additional target.

				<li><p><strong>Third Eye (1 Intellect point):</strong> You visualize a place within short range and cast your mind to that place, creating an immobile, invisible sensor for one minute or until you choose to end this ability. While using your third eye, you see through your sensor instead of your eyes using your normal visual abilities. You may perceive the area around your body using your other senses as normal.

You must touch the device to diagnose it. Typically a successful roll means that you learn the main problem and its cause. For example, you could learn that a bricked phone is infected with malware, a pipe is clogged with "flushable" wipes, or a rattling engine needs motor oil. This ability is unreliable at best when used on alien, high-technology, or other mysterious devices. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 73, 75)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Network Tap (4 Intellect points):</strong> You can ask the GM one question and get a very short answer if you succeed on an Intellect roll against a difficulty assigned by the GM. The more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. On a failed roll, feedback or perhaps some defense from the network you're accessing inflicts 4 points of Intellect damage on you (ignores Armor). Action. <span class="og-ref">(165)</span></p></li>

This ability works only if at least 80 percent of the original device is still on hand. The device may still need fuel, oil, or other substances that aid its operation but are not part of the electronics or mechanism.

The level of the item determines the difficulty of the task, but the appropriateness of the materials eases or hinders it as well. Generally, the object can be no larger than something you can hold in one hand, and it functions once (or, in the case of a weapon or similar item, is essentially useful for one encounter). If you spend at least ten minutes on the task, you can create an item of level 5 or lower. You can't change the nature of the materials involved. For example, you can't take iron rods and make a pile of gold coins or a wicker basket. Action. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span></p></li>

			<p>You can use spells and psionic abilities you've learned in the following ways. When you do, you also pay any Pool point costs for activating the ability.</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled og-ind">
				<li><p><strong>Recovery Roll:</strong> As an <a href="#action">action</a>&mdash;or part of another action, if the ability is an Enabler&mdash; you can expend a one-action, ten-minute, or one-hour <a href="#taking-damage">recovery roll</a> to activate a spell or psionic ability.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Time:</strong> You can spend time concentrating deeply&mdash;or otherwise using all your actions&mdash;to activate a spell or psionic ability. A low-tier ability requires ten minutes, a mid-tier ability takes an hour, and a high-tier ability takes ten hours.</p></li>

			<p>If you have magical focus like <a href="#focus-masters-spells">Masters Spells</a>, or an explicitly psionic one like <a href="#focus-commands-mental-powers">Commands Mental Powers</a>, or some other aspect of your character&mdash;such as a <a href="#flavor-magic">magic flavor</a>&mdash;makes you explicitly magical or psionic, you can prepare abilities you've learned by spending at least one uninterrupted hour performing a suitable activity&mdash;studying a spellbook, praying to a god, meditating, or concentrating. Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind, and must be done soon after a ten-hour recovery roll.</p>
			<p class="og-ind">When you prepare your spells or psionic abilities, you can exchange up to three <a href="#type">type</a> or <a href="#focus">focus</a> abilities with spells or psionic abilities you've learned. Both abilities must be of the same ability category&mdash;low, mid or high.</p>

				<li id="ability-cantrip-bee">
					<p><strong>Bee Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You summon a nearby level 0 bee, housefly, gnat, or similar flying pest to a spot within an immediate distance. The pest acts normally and (appearing in an unfamiliar area) probably begins flying around, possibly landing on a creature. The cantrip doesn't work if there are no suitable pests within a short distance. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 82)</span></p>

				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-chill">
					<p><strong>Chill Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You lower the temperature of a target within short range. If the target is a creature, for the next couple of rounds they feel like they're standing under an air conditioning vent. If the target is an object no larger than a 1-foot (30 cm) cube, you cool it down as if you'd dunked it into a bucket of ice. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 82)</span></p>

When used on clothing, this also does a decent job of removing wrinkles. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 82)</span></p>

				<li id="ability-cantrip-color">
					<p><strong>Color Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You change the color of an object, or you brighten or dull its color.

					<p><strong>Convenient Rideshare Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> When using a rideshare or taxi app, you are connected with a driver who can pick you up within a couple of minutes. If you use this cantrip in a remote area where drivers are scarce, results can get strange; for example, the car and driver might be ghosts, you might have to share your ride with a dangerous supernatural creature, or you might arrive at your destination minutes before or hours after you were picked up.

					<p><strong>Cooking Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You accelerate the preparation and cooking of one dish, reducing the time until it's ready by about ten minutes.

Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 83)</span></p>

				<li id="ability-cantrip-cut">
					<p><strong>Cut Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You cut an object up to level 2 as if using a sharp knife or a pair of scissors, up to an immediate distance away.

				<li id="ability-cantrip-darkness">
					<p><strong>Darkness Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You suppress light in a cubic or spherical area about 1 foot (30 cm) across within an immediate distance. Outdoors or in bright light, this area becomes very dim; otherwise, it becomes darkness. When you create this area, decide if it remains at a specific location (such as on a desk) or if it is attached to some part of you (such as your head or left hand) and moves with you.

					<p><strong>Erase Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You erase up to a page of text from a typical surface (such as paper, parchment, wood, or plastic) within immediate range.

					<p><strong>Exterminate Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create a bolt of energy that kills one common vermin creature (level 0) within a short distance, such as a fly, worm, cockroach, or mouse. One casting can affect multiple smaller creatures (such as ants or fleas) within 1 cubic foot. The spell is accompanied by a quick bolt of black and yellow energy.

				<li id="ability-cantrip-extra-chair">
					<p><strong>Extra Chair Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> A table you touch somehow has room (and a chair) for one more person to comfortably sit there without affecting anyone else at the table.

				<li id="ability-cantrip-extra-fries">
					<p><strong>Extra Fries Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You update a recent fast food or delivery order so that when it arrives, it includes an additional order of French fries or other side available from the restaurant (tater tots, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and so on).

				<li id="ability-cantrip-firework">
					<p><strong>Firework Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create an illusory firework within short range, which bursts with sparkling lights and a loud pop. The effect is obviously an illusion but might distract or startle people who aren't expecting it. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 84)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-flavor">
					<p><strong>Flavor Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You touch one plate or bowl of food or one large glass or mug of liquid, improving its flavor. This doesn't affect the nutritional value or texture, nor does it fix spoiled food; it just makes it taste more to your preference (so you could eat spoiled meat or moldy vegetables and they'd taste fine). You decide the sort of flavor change&mdash;more or less spicy, salty, savory, sweet, and so on, in any combination appropriate for food or drink. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 84)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-forbidden-topic">
					<p><strong>Forbidden Topic Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> Wards an immediate area (enough to cover a large table at a holiday family gathering) against conversation about a topic of your choice, such as "the election," "Mommy's trial," or "that Cordell kid." Anytime someone in the area attempts to talk about this topic, make an Intellect-based roll against them; success means they either talk about something else or remain silent. The cantrip lasts for ten minutes or until you fail an Intellect-based roll to stop someone from talking about that topic. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 84)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-gather">
					<p><strong>Gather Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You gather a scattered bunch of items into a small space, as if you had spent a minute sweeping them together with your hands or a broom. This affects about 1 square yard (1 sq m), up to an immediate distance away. The cantrip is mainly useful for collecting things that have been spilled, or for making it easier to clean up a room. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 84)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-ghostly-wings">
					<p><strong>Ghostly Wings Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You sprout a pair of ghostly wings that immediately unfurl, then vanish a few seconds later. If you cast this cantrip while falling, you reduce the damage from the fall by 1 point. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 84)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-green-light">
					<p><strong>Green Light Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You tweak the traffic lights at an intersection within long range so that one of them turns green within a few seconds. The other lights in that system automatically adjust to compensate (turning yellow and then red for cross traffic). Depending on that traffic system, the light remains green anywhere from about ten seconds to a minute. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 84)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-hand">
					<p><strong>Hand Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You levitate or manipulate an object of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or less at up to a short distance. The effect is not particularly strong&mdash;about the same strength as trying to push, pull, or twist something just using the strength of your hand (without your arm). Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 85)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-hide">
					<p><strong>Hide Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You conceal one target within immediate range for about a minute. The target can be no larger than a typical rabbit, or several objects no larger than dice. The target is basically invisible to anyone in front of you, but the illusion doesn't work on anyone to your side or behind you. (If someone is intent on seeing the invisible target, make an Intellect-based attack roll against them to hide it from their view.) Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 85)</span></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li id="ability-cantrip-light-switch">
					<p><strong>Light Switch Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You toggle up to four light controls (such as a wall switch or a lamp's button, knob, or pull cord) within short range. You must be able to see these light controls or have a clear idea of where they are (such as turning on your front porch light and living room floor lamp from outside your home). You can toggle these switches on or off in any combination. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 85)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-loudness">
					<p><strong>Loudness Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You amplify your voice, allowing you to speak at up to three times your normal volume. This isn't enough to harm anyone, but you can speak comfortably to a large crowd or across a very long distance without effort. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 85)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-mask">
					<p><strong>Mask Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create a costume mask on the face of a creature you touch. The mask can be simple (like a domino mask), fancy (like a masquerade ball mask), or deceptive (like a Halloween costume mask of a monster or specific person). The mask is obviously just a mask, not a disguise, but a deceptive mask viewed from at least a short distance away might fool someone into thinking it's a real face, providing an asset to disguise tasks at this range. The mask lasts for about a minute. If removed, the mask immediately disappears. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 85)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-mending">
					<p><strong>Mending Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You touch a broken object of up to level 3 and attempt to magically repair a single break or tear in it, such as a cracked stone wall, a shattered hand mirror, or a torn piece of clothing. The damage can be no larger than about what you can cover with both of your open hands. If you succeed at an Intellect-based roll against the object's level, you repair it (although it still shows signs of being previously broken, and may be fragile there). You can use this ability multiple times on the same object to repair larger breaks. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 85)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-message">
					<p><strong>Message Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You whisper a short message (about five to ten seconds) to a creature you can see within a long distance. The target hears it as if you had whispered it in their ear. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 85)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-mystic-eyes">
					<p><strong>Mystic Eyes Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You change the appearance of your eyes. If you just change their color to a different hue (such as to blue, green, or brown), the change lasts for an hour. If you change them to something unusual, such as red, yellow, solid black, or glowing, it only lasts for a minute. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 85)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-obedient-flames">
					<p><strong>Obedient Flames Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You affect flames within a short distance, making them appear brighter or dimmer, flicker strangely, or change color. This lasts for one minute. You can affect up to several dozen candles, a few torches, or one typical campfire with each casting of the cantrip. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-open-and-close">
					<p><strong>Open and Close Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You open or close a small object within short range, such as a bag, box, bottle, footlocker, window, or lightweight door. This cantrip cannot lock or unlock locks. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-pen">
					<p><strong>Pen Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You write with your finger on a surface for up to ten minutes as if using a common ballpoint pen. The "ink" immediately dries once you write, but it can be smeared or cleaned up like a normal pen. The ink is blue, black, or dark brown, decided when you cast this cantrip. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-present">
					<p><strong>Present Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You teleport an object within an immediate distance into your upturned hand. The item has to be something you're carrying (such as a gem in your pouch or a dagger in your boot), something you can see (such as a coffee cup or mobile phone on the other side of the table), or something you know is within range (such as a note you saw someone put in their pocket). The cantrip affects one small object (for example, a cup or mobile phone) or up to a dozen smaller items from the same location (perhaps coins or dice). Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-quiet">
					<p><strong>Quiet Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You muffle the noise from one target within a short distance for a few seconds. Breaking a window or knocking a glass off the table would be no louder than someone tapping their finger on the glass. An obnoxious security alarm would only be as loud as a computer speaker. A ringing phone would be barely audible. If you cast this on a willing creature, they gain an asset on stealth tasks for one round if they move no more than an immediate distance on their turn. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-rainbow">
					<p><strong>Rainbow Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create a softly glowing band of colors resembling a rainbow, extending from your hand to an object or willing creature within short range. The far end doesn't move (a creature could move away from it by going around a corner or out of range). You can anchor your end in place or allow it to move when your hand moves. The rainbow gives off light like a candle and lasts about a minute. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-reshape">
					<p><strong>Reshape Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You change the shape of a metal, glass, or stone object you touch into a different shape. For example, you could turn a coin into a ring, a cup into a plate, or a piece of glass into something resembling a gemstone. This normally lasts about a minute, but the object tends to revert early if anyone else touches or examines it too closely. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-smoke">
					<p><strong>Smoke Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create a harmless puff of smoke within an immediate distance. The smoke fills about a 1-foot (30 cm) cube and dissipates over the next few rounds. You decide if the smoke is white, grey, blue, brown, green, red, or yellow. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-sprout">
					<p><strong>Sprout Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You make seeds sprout at an accelerated rate, causing a week's worth of growth to happen in just a few moments. The seeds must be within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube and no more than an immediate distance from you. If the seeds are in viable soil, they take root as if planted there. If cast on immature or closed flowers, they bloom. If cast on a piece of unripe fruit, it immediately ripens. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-stitch">
					<p><strong>Stitch Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You sew two touched pieces of cloth or thin leather together, up to about 2 square yards (1.5 sq m). The stitches are of the same quality of hand stitching by a tailor or leatherworker of reasonable skill. You choose the path of the stitches, so you could create a piece of clothing by casting this cantrip several times. Instead of sewing together two items, you can unravel the stitches of a touched object, affecting up to 2 square yards (1.5 sq m). Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 86)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-tattoo">
					<p><strong>Tattoo Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create an image on your skin, as if tattooed there by a reasonably talented artist. The image can be no larger than your hand, and consists of just one color. You can cast this cantrip multiple times to create a larger tattoo, use more colors, or both. The image lasts about an hour. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-throwing-stone">
					<p><strong>Throwing Stone Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You summon a nearby object of stone, brick, concrete, cement, asphalt, or a similar hard and common mineral to your hand. The cantrip doesn't work if there are no suitable loose materials within a short distance. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-tie">
					<p><strong>Tie Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You control a piece of string, rope, or twine within short range, causing it to tie itself to another object within 1 foot (30 cm) of it, using any sort of simple, common knot (such as a square knot). Instead of tying a knot, you can cast this cantrip on a simple knot within short range, untying it. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-tiny-illusion">
					<p><strong>Tiny Illusion Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create a single image of a creature or object within immediate range. The image must fit within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube. The image can move (for example, you could make the illusion of a mouse jump or crawl around), but it can't leave the area defined by the cube. The illusion includes sound (up to the volume of a person's normal speaking voice) but not smell. It lasts for one minute, but if you want to change the original illusion significantly&mdash;such as making a creature appear to be wounded&mdash; you must concentrate on it again (though doing so doesn't cost additional Intellect points). If you move beyond immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes. Action to create; action to modify. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-tremor">
					<p><strong>Tremor Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You make the ground or floor vibrate within a short area, feeling similar to a mild earthquake. Other objects on the floor might vibrate or slide (no more than a hand's span) because of this vibration. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-warm">
					<p><strong>Warm Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You raise the temperature in a very small area (about 1 cubic foot) within short range, enough to make someone's face feel flushed or warm a drink to about the temperature of freshly served coffee. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-wash-car">
					<p><strong>Wash Car Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You clean the outside of a typical passenger automobile within immediate range as if it had gone through an automatic car wash. Very large or very dirty cars may require multiple castings. The cantrip works on motorcycles, bicycles, and other small vehicles as well. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-wet-or-dry">
					<p><strong>Wet or Dry Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You alter the moisture level of an object or area within immediate range, affecting about a 1-foot (30 cm) cube or one set of clothing. If you want the target to be wetter, it is dampened as if you poured a cup of water on it. If you want it drier, it is dried as if you hung it out in the sun on a warm day. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-wireless-network">
					<p><strong>Wireless Network Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You improve wireless network reception in an immediate area for ten minutes. This improves poor or average reception to full strength and zero bars to at least one bar. When you cast this cantrip, you decide if this improved reception affects everyone in the area or just you. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-wrap">
					<p><strong>Wrap Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You use available materials to wrap up an object within an immediate distance. The wrapped object must fit within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube. For example, you could wrap a gift box with decorative paper, wrap a piece of paper around a letter to create an envelope, or wrap a pile of potatoes with burlap to create an easily carried bundle. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>
				</li>
				<li id="ability-cantrip-youth">
					<p><strong>Youth Cantrip (1 Intellect point):</strong> You change the appearance of your face so you look about ten years younger than your normal appearance, lasting about an hour. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 87)</span></p>

The familiar doesn't make attacks, but they can use their action to grant you an asset for any one attack you make on your turn.

				<li><p><strong>Breaking Even:</strong> When they wish, a Cardsharp doesn't walk away from a game or bet having lost any money. They may not have any winnings, either (especially if they didn't use their Cardsharp abilities), but at least they're not out any money. The specific mechanism of how this happens varies by game and circumstance, but somehow, the invisible force associated with the Cardsharp tweaks the situation so the Cardsharp breaks even. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 68)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Cloud Personal Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> If you interact with or study a target for at least a round, you gain a sense of how its mind works, which you can use against it in the most blunt fashion possible. You can attempt to confuse it and make it forget what's just happened. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory. Action to prepare; action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(119)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Convincing Lie:</strong> For ten minutes, the Shyster gains +1 to Intellect Edge and eases Intellect defense rolls by two steps. Deception tasks are eased by two steps. Wink, raise an eyebrow, or quirk mouth (part of same action) to activate. <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 70)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Create Deadly Poison (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You create one dose of a level 2 poison that either inflicts 5 points of damage or hinders the poisoned creature's actions for ten minutes (your choice each time you create the poison). You can apply this poison to a weapon, food, or drink as part of the action of creating it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the poison; each level of Effort used in this way increases the poison level by 1. If unused, the poison loses its potency after one hour. Action. <span class="og-ref">(123)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Critter Companion:</strong> A level 1 creature accompanies you and follows your instructions. This creature is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg) and is normally some sort of domesticated species. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you'll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The critter companion acts on your turn. As a level 1 creature, it has a target number of 3 and 3 health, and it inflicts 1 point of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If your critter companion dies, you can search an urban or wild environment for 1d6 days to find a new one. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(123)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Critter Telekinesis (1 Intellect point):</strong> You telekinetically move a small creature (no larger than a medium dog) an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the creature, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The creature safely arrives at your chosen location without any residual force. If the creature knows you and you have a free hand, you can automatically grab the creature as part of the action of using this ability. This ability lacks the fine control to move anything with much speed, so in most situations, it's used to reposition an animal (such as a pet) out of a dangerous or inconvenient location. For example, you could safely pull a scared cat out from under a bed, retrieve a puppy from a storm drain, or relocate a wild bird that got inside your house. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 66)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Deck to Hand:</strong> The Cardsharp gains a new deck of cards, set of dice, coin to flip, or other small gambling token required for the game at hand. How the Cardsharp gains the object varies&mdash;someone may give the deck, dice, or coin to the Cardsharp, the Cardsharp could find an extra one in their clothing, or it could just turn up. Action (obviously not one requiring an associated drawn card, dice throw, or coin flip). <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 68)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Deflect Attacks (1 Intellect point):</strong> Using your mind, you protect yourself from incoming attacks. For the next ten minutes, you are trained in Speed defense tasks. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Dimensional Squeeze (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You cram yourself into a transitional dimension, allowing you to instantaneously appear anywhere you choose within short range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to that location. You can pass through an intervening barrier if it has an open space that you could easily fit your head through&mdash;about 1 square foot (30 cm by 30 cm square). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to pass through a smaller opening in a barrier; each level of Effort used in this way reduces the minimum opening size by one-fourth. You land safely when you use this ability. Action. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 52)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Evade All Consequence:</strong> A mark who finally realizes that they've been conned by the Shyster doesn't come looking for revenge if the Shyster doesn't want them to. The Shyster may not have succeeded in their confidence game, especially if they didn't use their Shyster abilities, but at least their bones remain unbroken. The specific mechanism of how all consequences are evaded varies by game and circumstance, but somehow, the invisible hand of fate tweaks the situation so the Shyster isn't taken in or hurt. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 70)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Eye Gouge (2 Speed points):</strong> You make an attack against a creature with an eye. The attack is hindered, but if you hit, the creature has trouble seeing for the next hour. During this time, the creature's tasks that rely on sight (which is most tasks) are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(138)</span></p></li>

Once you've familiarized yourself with an area, all your tasks related to perception, navigation, salvaging and scavenging, defense, and moving about the area gain an asset.

				<li><p><strong>Hush (1+ Intellect point):</strong> You create a transparent bubble within short range that muffles very loud sounds within it, such as alarms, sirens, leaf blowers, and crying babies. The bubble is about 3 feet (1 m) across and any noise from within it comes out no louder than a normal speaking voice. The bubble lasts for one minute and moves with the target. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; one level of Effort increases the duration to ten minutes, two levels increases it to an hour, and three levels increases it to ten hours.

				<li><p><strong>Illusory Evasion (5 Intellect points):</strong> When you would be hit by an attack, you teleport an immediate distance away, leaving behind an illusory copy of yourself to be struck by that attack instead of you. This destroys the illusion but leaves you unharmed by the attack. If the attack affects an area and the teleportation can't get you out of that area, the attack still affects you normally. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(150)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Impetus (2 Intellect points):</strong> A loose object within short range that you could carry in one hand is drawn to your free hand.

				<li><p><strong>Iron Liver:</strong> When they wish, an Inebriate doesn't suffer ill effects of alcohol, including descending steps on the intoxication track (see boxed text). Instead, they can put down shot after shot of whiskey or other drink with no apparent effect, other than being able to access the abilities noted. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 67)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Late Inspiration (3 Intellect points):</strong> You retry a task you failed within the past one minute, using the same difficulty and modifiers, except this time you have an asset on the task. If this retry fails, you can't use this ability to retry it again. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(157)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Lead From the Front:</strong> You gain 3 new points to divide among your stat Pools however you wish. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(157)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Link Senses (2 Intellect points):</strong> You touch a willing creature and link its senses to yours for one minute. At any time during that duration, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell what that creature is experiencing, instead of using your own senses. If you or the creature move out of long range, the connection is broken. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(158)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Magnification (1+ Intellect point):</strong> You create a rectangular frame, visible only to you, that doubles the magnification of whatever you see through it. The frame defaults to hovering in front of your face about an arm's length away, but you can use your action to move it up, down, or to either side. The frame lasts for ten minutes and grants an asset on perception tasks at range. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can increase the magnification by another increment (&times;3 for one level of Effort, &times;4 for two levels of Effort, and so on). Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 66)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Misdirect (3 Speed points):</strong> When an opponent misses you, you can redirect their attack to another target (a creature or object) of your choosing that's within immediate range of you. Make an unmodified attack roll against the new target (do not use any of your or the opponent's modifiers to the attack roll, but you can apply Effort for accuracy). If the attack hits, the target takes damage from your opponent's attack. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(163)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Negotiate (3 Intellect points):</strong> In any gathering where two or more people are trying to establish the truth or come to a decision, you can sway the verdict with masterful rhetoric. If you are given a few rounds or more to argue your point, either the decision goes your way or, if someone else effectively argues a competing point, any associated persuasion or deception task is eased by two steps. Action to initiate, one or more rounds to complete. <span class="og-ref">(165)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Phased Pocket (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You connect yourself for one hour to a small space that is out of phase and moves with you. You can access this space as if it were a convenient pocket or bag, but nobody else can perceive or access the space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space can hold up to 1 cubic foot. The space is a part of you, so you can't use it to carry more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the space harms you, and so on. When the connection ends, anything in the space falls out. For each 2 additional Intellect points you spend, the pocket lasts an additional hour. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(170)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Quick Thinking:</strong> If a Shyster succeeds on an Intellect defense roll for any reason, they gain an action. They can use it immediately even if they have already taken a turn (or multiple turns) in the round, but each use requires a connection roll. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 71)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Quicker Than Most:</strong> Experience has honed your reaction times, because those who act first gain the advantage in most situations. You're trained in tasks related to initiative, seeing underlying patterns, and solving puzzles. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Remote Slap (3 Intellect points):</strong> You use an active telephone, cellular, internet, or closed-circuit video connection to slap a creature. The target must be actively using a device making use of this connection, such as being on the other end of a phone call or text message, browsing the same social media website or app you're using, or monitoring a closed-circuit camera that is recording you. Make an Intellect-based attack against the creature; success means the creature takes 1 point of damage, as if they had been telekinetically slapped in the face by the device they're using. Each additional remote slap against that creature is hindered by an additional step (resetting after one hour). Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 67)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Resist Underwater Hazards:</strong> Whether you're resisting crushing waters while exploring the depths or a sting from a poisonous fish, all defense tasks while submerged in water are eased. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(176)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Restful Presence:</strong> Creatures who make a recovery roll within short range of you add +1 to their roll. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(177)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Sculpt Flesh (2 Intellect points):</strong> You cause a willing creature's fingers to lengthen into claws and their teeth to grow into fangs. The effect lasts for ten minutes. The damage dealt by the target's unarmed strikes increases to 4 points. Action. <span class="og-ref">(180)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Share Memory (3 Intellect points):</strong> You share a memory of your choice with a willing creature you touch. The length of the shared memory can be no longer than about five minutes, but you can summarize longer memories (such as how you met, courted, and married your partner) with a "montage" that covers the most important details and underlying sentiment. The target experiences the memory as an instantaneous vision, and is aware that it is your memory rather than their own memory or experience. The memory is as vivid and accurate as you personally remember it. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 67)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Shuffle Wizard:</strong> For ten minutes, the Cardsharp gains +1 to Speed Edge and eases Speed defense rolls by two steps. Tasks to distract onlookers by the Cardsharp's ability to shuffle and manipulate cards are also eased by two steps. Draw card, throw dice, or flip coin (each a separate action) to activate. <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 68)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Shyster's Face:</strong> The Shyster's face seems to peel away and reforms in some other guise, allowing them to hide their identity or attempt to impersonate someone else, granting two assets to any tasks involving disguise for one hour. Wink, raise an eyebrow, or quirk mouth (part of same action) to activate. <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 71)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Slip Into Shadow (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You attempt to slip away from a selected target and hide from view in a nearby shadow, behind a tree or a furnishing, or in the next room, even if in full view of the target. For each level of Effort applied, you can attempt to affect one additional target, as long as all your targets are next to each other. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(183)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Soul Familiar:</strong> You have a soul familiar who accompanies you and follows your instructions. Your soul and their soul are interconnected (or the familiar might actually be a physical manifestation of your soul). The familiar loves and cares for you like the best combination of a pet and a close friend.</p><p class="og-ind">The familiar is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg); a typical soul familiar looks like a bird, cat, rat, lizard, snake, or toad, but more unusual forms (such as a tiny demon, dragon, elemental, fey creature, or floating skull) are also possible. You and the GM must work out the details of your familiar, and you'll probably make rolls for them in combat or when they take actions. The familiar acts on your turn. Their movement is based on their creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on).</p><p class="og-ind">You and your familiar can communicate telepathically within long range, or empathically within very long range. Beyond this range, you can only sense each other's general level of well-being.</p><p class="og-ind">Your familiar's presence within short range counts as an asset for magical tasks that require at least one minute to activate or maintain.</p><p class="og-ind">If your familiar is within an immediate distance of you, you can roll any defense task for them, gaining the benefit of your skills, assets, and Effort (the familiar's Speed defense tasks are eased by two steps due to their size). While within this distance, your familiar also gains the benefit of any ongoing spell you cast on yourself (for example, if you cast a spell on yourself that lets you breathe water, your familiar can breathe water).</p><p class="og-ind">Foes can use your soul familiar's connection to you against you. If a foe is holding or restraining your familiar (or touching it while it is held or restrained by another creature or a device, such as manacles or a cage), the foe's attacks and defenses against you are eased.</p><p class="og-ind">If an attack against your familiar would reduce their health to 0, you can magically intervene so their health is instead reduced to 1 and you move one step down. If your familiar dies, you move one step down the damage track. If you die, your familiar instantly dies. You can replace a dead familiar (or revive them, if you have their remains) by performing a magical ritual that takes 1d6 days.</p><p class="og-ind">Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 68)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Task Training:</strong> Choose one task (other than attacks or defense) that you are not trained or specialized in. You become trained in that task. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Through example, acts of camaraderie, stories of martial prowess, or other forms of instruction, you and your allies work better together as a cohesive unit. During any round in which you rally your team (by spending 2 Intellect points as part of another action), you and your allies inflict 1 additional point of damage in combat. This benefit applies only to allies with whom you have spent the last 24 hours. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to your allies' company within 24 hours. If you leave for more than 24 hours, you must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Thrust (1 Might point):</strong> This is a powerful melee stab. You make an attack and inflict 1 additional point of damage if your weapon has a sharp edge or point. Action. <span class="og-ref">(191)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Trained Excavator:</strong> You are trained in perception, climbing, and salvaging tasks. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Trained Swimmer:</strong> While underwater, you are trained in escaping, perception, sneaking, and swimming tasks, as well as in tasks to identify aquatic creatures and geography. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(193)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Unflinching:</strong> For ten minutes, the Inebriate gains +1 to Armor and eases Might defense rolls by two steps. For the same period, the Inebriate gains one extra step on the damage track called hurt, which is effectively the same as hale but a bit rougher looking. Drink (separate action) to activate. <span class="og-ref">(HNAM, 67)</span></p>
				<li><p><strong>Vanish (2 Intellect points):</strong> You become invisible for a short amount of time. While invisible, you have an asset on stealth and Speed defense tasks. The invisibility ends at the end of your next turn, or if you do something to reveal your presence or position&mdash;attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. Action. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Answering Attack (3 Speed points):</strong> If you are struck in melee, you can make an immediate melee attack against that attacker once per round. The attack is hindered, and you can still take your normal action during the round. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Aquatic Combatant:</strong> You ignore penalties for any action (including fighting) in underwater environments. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(110)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Biomorphic Detonation (7+ Might points):</strong> You radiate a pulse of biomorphic energy up to a short distance away, but you tune it to disrupt life in an area an immediate distance across. All within the detonation take 5 points of damage that ignores Armor (unless it is Armor provided by a force field effect). If you apply additional Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(113)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Break the Line (4 Intellect points):</strong> You have an eye for group discipline and hierarchy, even among your foes. If a group of foes is gaining any kind of benefit from working together, you can attempt to disrupt that benefit by pointing out the weak spot in the enemy's line, formation, or swarm attack. This effect lasts for up to a minute or until all the affected foes spend a round assessing and resetting themselves to regain their normal advantage. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><p><strong>Blackout (3 Intellect points):</strong> You issue a disruptive ripple of energy within short range, creating an area where the electrical power grid fails. All devices relying on being plugged into the grid stop working. Battery-powered devices still work. Any standby generator connected in this area functions normally, activating emergency power within a few rounds. The blackout otherwise lasts for one minute. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 65)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Bypass Barrier (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You get past a door, force field, or other barrier up to 3 feet (1 m) thick that is blocking your way. Depending on the barrier, this might involve finding a weak spot you can push through, pressing the right button by luck, just breaking through, or even weirder explanations like touching a thin place between dimensions or an unexpected interaction with your equipment. The difficulty of the task is the level of the barrier. This ability allows you alone to pass through, not anyone else, and the way through closes at the end of your turn (which might mean you're trapped on the far side). You have an asset in any attempts to get through it again. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum thickness of the barrier, each level adding 3 feet (1 m). Action. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Counter Danger (4 Intellect points):</strong> You negate a source of potential danger related to one creature or object within immediate distance for one minute (instead of one round, as with Foil Danger). This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a creature's natural ability, or a trap triggered by a pressure plate. You can also try to counter an action (like moving or making a conventional mundane attack with a weapon, a claw, etc.). Action. <span class="og-ref">(122)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Creature Insight (3 Intellect points):</strong> When examining any nonhuman creature, you can ask the GM one question to gain an idea of its level, its capabilities, what it eats, what motivates it, what its weaknesses are (if any), how it can be repaired, or any other similar query. This is for difficult or strange creatures beyond those readily identified by using skills. Action. <span class="og-ref">(123)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Dazing Attack (3 Might points):</strong> You hit your foe in just the right spot, dazing them so that tasks they attempt on their next turn are hindered. This attack inflicts normal damage. Action. <span class="og-ref">(125)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Deep Resources:</strong> You gain an additional 6 points to your Speed Pool. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(126)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Detect Life (3+ Might points):</strong> You consciously send out a pulse of your life energy. You detect all living creatures within short range, even if they are behind cover, though not if they're behind a force field. When you detect a creature, you detect its general location (to within an immediate range). If you apply two additional levels of Effort, you can increase the range of detection to long. Action. <span class="og-ref">(128)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Device Insight (3 Intellect points):</strong> When examining any unknown, alien, or high-technology device, you can ask the GM one question to gain an idea of its capabilities, how it functions, how it can be activated or deactivated, what its weaknesses are (if any), how it can be repaired, or any other similar query. This is for difficult or strange things beyond those readily identified by using the appropriate knowledge or technical skill. Action. <span class="og-ref">(128)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Divide Your Mind (7 Intellect points):</strong> You split your consciousness into two parts. For one minute, you can take two actions on each of your turns, but only one of them can be to use a special ability. Action. <span class="og-ref">(130)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Effective Skill:</strong> Choose one noncombat skill when you gain this ability. You get a minor effect with that skill when you roll a natural 14 or higher (the d20 shows "14" or more). You get a major effect with that skill when you roll a natural 19 or higher (the d20 shows "19" or higher). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, you must choose a different noncombat skill. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(133)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Experienced Finder (6+ Intellect points):</strong> When you are looking for something specific, such as a particular rare component, a chemical needed to complete a vaccine for a disease, a spare part required to repair a damaged device, the tracks of a specific beast, or the sword that a thief stole from you, this ability is of great use. For the next 24 hours, if you come within short range of the thing and circumstances are such that it is possible for you to perceive the thing (for example, it's not in a locked chamber for which you do not have the key), you find it. This ability assumes that you are constantly on the lookout, always looking everywhere possible, peering behind obstacles, and so on&mdash;if you're running for your life, sleeping, or otherwise occupied, this ability does not help you. You use this ability in lieu of making a roll to find the thing, but only if the difficulty for finding the object is level 6 or below. You can apply Effort to increase the maximum level of the thing you're trying to find (each level of Effort used this way increases the maximum level by 1). Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(136)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Expert Crafter:</strong> Instead of rolling, you can choose to automatically succeed on a crafting task you're trained in. The task must be difficulty 4 or lower.

Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(137)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Facsimile of Life (3 Intellect points):</strong> You give an object limited mobility, awareness, and intellect, allowing it to move about as if it were a small pet. The object must be within immediate distance and no larger than half your size. When animated, the object can perform tasks for you as if it were a level 1 creature, but otherwise is treated as an object of its level (for example, it uses the object damage track instead of health). The animation lasts for an hour or until you and it are at least a long distance apart, at which time the object becomes inert again. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 66)</span></p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Flex Weapon Skill:</strong> At the beginning of each day, choose one type of attack: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy ranged. For the rest of that day, you are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. You can't use this ability with an attack skill in which you're already trained to become specialized. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 53)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Force to Reckon With:</strong> You can break through force fields and energy barriers as if they were physical walls. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(143)</span></p></li>
			</ul>

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Ghost Car (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You create a level 3 ghostly-looking car that can carry two people and a small amount of luggage. You or a creature you designate can drive the car as normal. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, it can carry two additional passengers and its level increases by 1. The car lasts for an hour, after which it vanishes. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 66)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Got a Feeling (4 Intellect points):</strong> You have an uncanny intuition when it comes to finding things. While exploring, you can extend your senses up to 1 mile (1.5 km) in any direction and ask the GM a very simple, general question&mdash;usually a yes-or-no question&mdash;about that area, such as "Is there an orc encampment nearby?" or "Is there dark matter to be found in that rusted hulk?" If the answer you seek is not in the area, you receive no information. Action. <span class="og-ref">(145)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Informer:</strong> You gain an informer within an allied community. They act as your secret (or known) informer. If something of note happens in your informer's location, they will use whatever means they have available to tell you about it. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(153)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Interruption (4 Intellect points):</strong> Your vociferous, booming command prevents a creature within short range from taking any action for one round. It can defend itself if attacked, but when it does so, its defense is hindered by two steps. Each additional time you attempt this ability against the same target, you must apply one more level of Effort than you applied on the previous attempt. Action. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Intense Interaction (3 Intellect points):</strong> You gain an asset on intimidating, persuading, and influencing people for ten minutes. Action. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Know Their Faults:</strong> If a creature that you can see has a special weakness, such as a vulnerability to loud noises, a negative modification to perception, and so on, you know what it is. Ask and the GM will tell you; usually, this is not associated with a roll, but in certain cases the GM may decide that there is a chance for you not to know. In these cases, you are specialized in knowing creature weaknesses. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Meticulous Planner:</strong> If you spend a long time planning an action, you gain an asset on performing it. The time to study and plan for the action is ten times as long as it takes to perform the action. For example, if you want to jump across a hole in the floor (one action), you can study the area for ten rounds (about a minute), and when you attempt to jump over the hole, you have an asset on the jump. This benefit applies to only one roll&mdash;if you want to perform the task again with the benefit of an asset, you need to study and plan again. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(162)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Mobile Fighter (3 Speed points):</strong> As part of your attack, you can leap on or over obstacles, swing from ropes, run along narrow surfaces, or otherwise move around the battlefield at your normal speed as if such tasks were routine (difficulty 0). You can't use this ability if your Speed Effort cost are reduced from wearing armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(163)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Modify Cyphers:</strong> You can take any two manifest cyphers and quickly jury-rig a new manifest cypher of the same level as the lowest-level cypher. You determine the function of the new cypher, but it must be that of a cypher you have used before (but not necessarily one you've ever built). The new cypher is a temperamental cypher, like those created with Always Tinkering. The original two cyphers are consumed in this process. This ability does not function if one or more of the original cyphers are temperamental cyphers. Action. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 54)</span></p></li>
				<li id="ability-network-dead-zone">
					<p><strong>Network Dead Zone (3 Intellect points):</strong> You interfere with radio signals, such as Bluetooth, wifi, cell phone service, AM/FM radio, ham radio, and walkie-talkies. Choose a short area within immediate range; all such transmissions into or out of that area are blocked due to a combination of interference and lack of reception. This lasts for one minute. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 66)</span></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p>Powerful radio sources, such as a radio station transmitter or a telecommunication satellite, may be able to punch through a Network Dead Zone spell.</p>
			</div>
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Paralyzing Touch (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You gather necromantic energy in your fingertip and touch a creature. A target of level 3 or lower is paralyzed and helpless for an hour. Each level of Effort applied increases the level cap of the target by 1. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 66)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Passing Mechanic:</strong> You are trained in tasks related to the repair and maintenance of a starcraft. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(168)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Play to the Crowd (3 Intellect points):</strong> You give a speech that is both rousing and terrifying. Those within short range who can hear and understand you have their next action either eased (an asset) or hindered&mdash;you choose, and it can be different for each individual. Action; a few rounds to complete. <span class="og-ref">(170)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Poison Resistance:</strong> Thanks to an injection of biological agents, a quaff of a magical elixir, a ring from a dying alien, or something just as extreme, you are now immune to poisons, toxins, or any kind of particulate threat. You are not immune to viruses, bacteria, or radiation. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(170)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Rider:</strong> You are trained in riding any kind of creature that serves as a mount, such as a noble warhorse. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(178)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Robot Improvement:</strong> Your artificial assistant from the Robot Assistance ability increases to level 4. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(179)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Soothe Mind and Body:</strong> The body and the mind are connected. All healing tasks you attempt are eased by two steps. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(184)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Spot Weakness:</strong> If a creature that you can see has a special weakness, such as a vulnerability to fire, a negative modification to perception, or so on, you know what it is. (Ask and the GM will tell you.) Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(185)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Statue Stasis (3 Intellect points):</strong> You transform into a lifelike bronze or stone statue of yourself for a specific period of time (one minute, one hour, ten hours, or twenty-four hours). When in statue form, you are in stasis; you don't age, can take no actions (other than making recovery rolls while you "sleep"), and gain +10 to Armor against all forms of damage, including damage not normally affected by Armor. If you take enough damage to get through your armor, the stasis effect immediately ends. Action. <span class="og-ref">(IOM, 68)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Swim (1+ Intellect points):</strong> You can swim like a fish through water and similar liquid for one hour. For each level of Effort applied, you can extend the duration by one hour. You swim about 10 miles (16 km) per hour, and you are not affected by currents in the water. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(188)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Tall Tale (3 Intellect points):</strong> You tell a short anecdote to a foe that can understand you about something you've witnessed in your life that's so over the top yet so convincing that, if you are successful, the foe is dazed for one minute, during which time its tasks are hindered. Action. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Thinking Ahead (variable Intellect points):</strong> You produce a remedy that removes a negative condition because you've previously spent considerable time thinking ahead and preparing for your current situation. For instance, if another character is poisoned, you produce an antidote, or if they're blinded, you produce a salve that returns sight (assuming they weren't blinded because their eyes were destroyed). The Intellect cost for using this ability is equal to the level of effect or creature that caused the negative condition. Action. <span class="og-ref">(191)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Verbal Misdirection (2+ Intellect points):</strong> With fast talk and bewildering words, you can confuse and distract anyone that you're speaking with, giving you an asset on social interactions with that person for ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect additional creatures (one per level of Effort). Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Wall With Teeth:</strong> You inflict 2 additional points of damage with all attacks when using your Living Wall ability. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(196)</span></p></li>

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Battlefield Tactician (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You scrutinize your surroundings, learning whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about attacking, defending, maneuvering, and dealing with environmental hazards within a short distance. For example, you might notice a pile of rubble you can stand on for an advantage in melee, a sheltered corner to help protect against enemy attacks, a less-slippery part of a frozen lake, or a place where the poison gas is thinner than elsewhere. If you (or someone you tell) move to that location, you (or they) gain an asset on tasks related to that optimal position (such as attack rolls from the high ground, Speed defense rolls from the sheltered corner, balance rolls on the frozen lake, or Might defense rolls against the poisonous cloud). Instead of gaining an advantageous location, you might learn of a disadvantageous location that you could use against your enemies, such as maneuvering them into an awkward corner that hinders their melee attacks or a weak spot on the frozen lake that will break if they stand on it. You can apply Effort to learn one additional good or bad location within range (one location per level of Effort), increase the range of this ability (another short distance per level of Effort), or both. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(112)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Biomorphic Detonation (7+ Might points):</strong> You radiate a pulse of biomorphic energy up to a short distance away, but you tune it to disrupt life in an area an immediate distance across. All within the detonation take 5 points of damage that ignores Armor (unless it is Armor provided by a force field effect). If you apply additional Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(113)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Blind Machine (6 Speed points):</strong> You deactivate the sensory apparatus of a machine, making it effectively blind until it can be repaired. You must either touch the target or strike it with a ranged attack (inflicting no damage). Action. <span class="og-ref">(114)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Boost Manifest Cypher Function (4 Intellect points):</strong> Add 3 to the functioning level of a manifest cypher that you activate with your next action, or change one aspect of its parameters (range, duration, area, etc.) by up to double or down to one tenth. Action. <span class="og-ref">(CTS, 51)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Break the Ranks (6 Speed points):</strong> You move up to a short distance and attack up to four different foes as a single action as long as they are all along your path. Any modifiers that apply to one attack apply to all the attacks you make. If you have another special ability that allows you to move and take an action, when you use Break the Ranks, you gain an asset to attacking these foes. Action. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Break Their Mind (7+ Intellect points):</strong> Using your clever words and knowledge of others, and given a couple of rounds of conversation to gain a few specific pieces of context regarding your target, you can utter a sentence designed to cause your target immediate psychological distress. If the target can hear and understand you, it suffers 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and forgets the last day of its life, which might mean it forgets you and how it came to be where it currently is. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to attempt to break the mind of one additional target who can hear and understand you. Action to initiate, action to complete. <span class="og-ref">(116)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Change the Paradigm (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You sway the worldview of a creature you spend at least one round speaking to, as long as it can understand you. The creature changes its mind on a significant belief, which could include something as straightforward as helping you instead of trying to kill you, or it could be something more esoteric. This effect lasts for at least ten minutes, but it can last longer if the creature wasn't previously your foe. During this time, the creature takes actions in accordance with the wisdom you have imparted to it. The target must be level 2 or lower. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target by one for each level of Effort applied. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(119)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Charging Horde (7 Might points):</strong> You and two or more of your <a href="#follower">followers</a> next to you can act like a single creature to make a charge attack. When you do, all of you move up to a short distance, during which time you can attack anything that comes within immediate range along your path with an asset to the attack. Targets that take damage take an additional 3 points and are knocked prone. Action. <span class="og-ref">(119)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Defensive Augmentation:</strong> By upgrading your nervous and immune systems, you are trained in Might defense and Speed defense tasks. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Destroyer (6 Might points):</strong> If you succeed on a Might task to damage an object, instead of descending one step on the object damage track, the object descends all three steps and is destroyed. Action. <span class="og-ref">(127)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Divide Your Mind (7 Intellect points):</strong> You split your consciousness into two parts. For one minute, you can take two actions on each of your turns, but only one of them can be to use a special ability. Action. <span class="og-ref">(130)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Divine Symbol (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You invoke divine power by scribing a glowing symbol in the air with your fingers. Writhing pillars of divine radiance spear up to five targets within long range. A successful attack on a target inflicts 5 points of damage. If you apply Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(131)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Effective Skill:</strong> Choose one noncombat skill when you gain this ability. You get a minor effectwith that skill when you roll a natural 14 or higher (the d20 shows "14" or more). You get a major effect with that skill when you roll a natural 19 or higher (the d20 shows "19" or higher). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, you must choose a different noncombat skill. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(133)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Explains the Ineffable:</strong> Through anecdotes, historical retellings, and citing knowledge that few but you have previously understood, you enlighten your friends. After spending 24 hours with you, once per day, each of your friends can ease a particular task by two steps. This benefit is ongoing while you remain in your friends' company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to your friends' company within 24 hours. If you leave your friends' company for longer than that, you must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(137)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Force and Accuracy:</strong> You inflict 3 additional points of damage with attacks using weapons that you throw. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(142)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Horde Tactics (7 Might points):</strong> For up to one hour a day, you and at least three other allies can act like a single creature. Use your stats, but add +8 to your Might Pool, +1 to your Might Edge, +2 to your Speed Pool, +1 to your Speed Edge, and +1 to your Armor. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(149)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Impossible Walk (5+ Speed points):</strong> You can walk (or crawl or run) on steep inclines and horizontal surfaces (such as walls and cliffs) for the next minute as if they were flat ground. When using this ability, "down" for you is either the surface you are walking on or the normal orientation of gravity (your choice). If you apply one level of Effort, you can also walk on the ceiling or on a liquid or semi-liquid surface such as water, mud, quicksand, or even lava (although touching a dangerous surface like lava still harms you). If you apply two levels of Effort, you can also walk on air as if it were solid ground. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(151)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Improved Command Spirit:</strong> When you use your Command Spirit ability, you can command a spirit or animate undead creature of up to level 7. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(151)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Infer Thoughts (4 Intellect points):</strong> If you interact with or study a target for at least a round, you can attempt to read its surface thoughts, even if the subject doesn't want you to. You must be able to see the target. Once you have gained a sense of what it's thinking&mdash;through its body language, its speech, and what it does and doesn't say&mdash;you can continue to infer the target's surface thoughts for up to one minute as long as you can still see and hear the target. Action to prepare; action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(153)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Inspiration (6 Intellect points):</strong> You speak words of encouragement and inspiration. All allies within short range who can hear you immediately gain a recovery roll, gain an immediate free action, and have an asset for that free action. The recovery roll does not count as one of their normal recovery rolls. Action. <span class="og-ref">(154)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Jaunt (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You instantaneously teleport yourself to any location within long distance that you can see. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the distance you can travel; each level of Effort used in this way increases the range by another 100 feet (30 m). Action. <span class="og-ref">(155)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Juggernaut (5 Might points):</strong> Until the end of the next round, you can move through solid objects such as doors and walls. Only 2 feet (60 cm) of wood, 1 foot (30 cm) of stone, or 6 inches (15 cm) of metal can stop your movement. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(156)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Lethal Ploy (5+ Intellect points):</strong> Long experience has revealed to you that subterfuge is your friend in desperate situations. You push, attack, or distract the target in some seemingly inconsequential way that leads to the target's death. The target must be level 2 or lower. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target by 1. Thus, to kill a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. Action. <span class="og-ref">(158)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Maneuvering Adept:</strong> If you apply at least one level of Effort to a task involving climbing, jumping, balancing, or some other kind of maneuvering, you get a free level of Effort. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(160)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Outside Reality (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You exist outside of everything until the start of your next turn. To you, a few seconds pass while you are alone in a cool void. To everyone else, you seem to vanish for a few seconds and reappear in the same place. While in this unreal state, you can use abilities or objects on yourself, but you can't perceive, interact with, or affect the rest of the world, and vice versa. Time-based effects already on you (like a poison that inflicts damage every round) are paused while you exist outside reality, but when this ability ends they resume as if no time had passed. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the duration; each level of Effort used in this way adds one round to how long you spend outside reality. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(168)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Rapid Recovery:</strong> You can make most recovery rolls faster than normal. You can make your one-action recovery roll as part of another action or when it isn't your turn, your ten-minute recovery roll takes you only one action, and your one-hour recovery roll takes you only ten minutes (your ten-hour rest is unchanged). If you make a recovery roll when it isn't your turn, until the end of your next turn all of your tasks are hindered. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(174)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Regenerate:</strong> Your ability to heal (whether from a potent spell, unique mutation, or cybernetic graft) continues to function even if you die from violence, as long as your body is mostly intact. One minute after your death, this ability activates and brings you back to life; however, you come back with a permanent 2-point deduction from your Intellect Pool. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(175)</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<div class="og-sidebar pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
				<p>A character might discover that Regenerate is both a blessing and a curse, because relying on it too much leads to a kind of malaise that vitality alone can't fix.</p>
			</div>
			<ul class="og-ability-details">
				<li><p><strong>Regenerate Other (9 Might points):</strong> You can confer your Regenerate ability on another creature that you touch and attempt to return it to life, as long as its body is mostly intact. (If you don't have the Regenerate ability, you gain it, but can use it only on yourself.) The difficulty of the task is equal to 3 plus the number of days the target has been dead. (If the body has been perfectly preserved in stasis or through some other non-damaging preservation mechanism, no time limit applies.) Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(175)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Shatter (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You interrupt the fundamental force holding normal matter together for a moment, causing the detonation of an object you choose within long range. The object must be a small, mundane item composed of homogeneous matter (such as a clay cup, an iron ingot, a stone, and so on). The object explodes in an immediate radius, dealing 1 point of damage to all creatures and objects in the area. If you apply Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action. <span class="og-ref">(182)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Subtle Tricks:</strong> You can use your skills and special abilities in ways that don't look like you're doing anything. If the skill or ability would normally require an obvious movement, phrase, or other action by you, it instead seems to happen on its own. Instead of using your tools to pick a lock, the lock clicks open as you stand near it. Instead of manipulating a computer screen, the information you want appears on the screen when you look at it. Instead of bluffing your way past some guards, they step aside as you approach and let you through. This ability usually only works up to an immediate distance. You still must spend points and make rolls to use your skills and abilities with Subtle Tricks. Using a skill or ability in a subtle way hinders the task. This ability can't be used to conceal your attack or defense rolls. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(187)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Taunt Foe (4 Might or Intellect points):</strong> You can make an attack on a foe as part of drawing an attack (which is not something you can do normally when attempting to draw an attack). In cases where an intelligent or determined foe isn't drawn to you, you can attempt an Intellect action as part of the attack. If that Intellect action is successful, the foe attacks you. Your defenses against that attack are hindered by one step, instead of being hindered by two steps as normal when drawing an attack. Enabler. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Teach Trick (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You spend an hour instructing someone on how to perform a type ability that you know. The ability must be no higher than fourth tier. For one hour after you teach them, the student can perform that ability as if it were natural for them. They must pay the Might, Speed, or Intellect cost (if any) to use that ability. The student must be able to understand your instructions. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase how long the student can use the ability or to teach additional students at the same time; each level of Effort used in this way increases the duration by one hour or the number of students by one. One hour to initiate. Action; hour to complete. <span class="og-ref">(189)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Will of a Leader (9 Intellect points):</strong> You harden your allies' dedication and capabilities. Each ally within immediate range gains +1 Edge to one stat of their choice for one hour. You also gain this benefit to one stat of your choice. Action. <span class="og-ref">(199)</span></p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Wind Chariot (7+ Intellect points):</strong> You summon winds that pick you up and allow you to fly for up to a long distance each round in combat or with an overland speed of up to 200 miles per hour (320 kph) for up to ten hours. For each level of Effort you apply, you can bring one ally of about your size with you through the air or increase the duration of the effect by one hour. Action to initiate. <span class="og-ref">(199)</span></p></li>
