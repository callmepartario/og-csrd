				<p>This document is a hypertext version of the February 10, 2023 edition of the <a
						href="http://csol.montecookgames.com/">Cypher System Reference Document (CSRD)</a>. It is
					intended to help Game Masters (GMs), players, and others interested in the Cypher System to learn
					more about it, create characters, worlds, and share stories together.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="about-goals">OG-CSRD Goals<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#about-goals" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>In compiling Old Gus' Cypher System Reference Document (OG-CSRD) from the source material, I had the
					following goals:</p>
				<h5 id="about-ease-of-use" class="og-csrd-header-small">Ease of Use<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#about-ease-of-use" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The document should be one single, self-enclosed page. The document should organize CSRD material as
					efficiently and consistently as possible, with "quick reference" navigation providing navigation to
					the most frequently used parts of the document. The document should be equally readable on a mobile
					phone, desktop, or screen-reader.</p>
				<h5 id="about-alignment-with-the-cypher-system-rulebook" class="og-csrd-header-small">Alignment with the
					Cypher System Rulebook<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#about-alignment-with-the-cypher-system-rulebook" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The document should generally align the CSRD content to the <a
						href="https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/">Cypher System
						Rulebook</a>. Players and GMs should have little trouble "getting on the same page" even if they
					are reading from the two different sources.</p>
				<h5 id="about-genre-and-editorial-spirit" class="og-csrd-header-small">Genre and Editorial Spirit<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#about-genre-and-editorial-spirit" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Care should be taken when incorporating content into a good single-stream reading order, unifying
					presentation and strengthening interplay between genres. Let the "chest of toys" metaphor in the
					Chapter 2 of the <a
						href="https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/">Cypher System
						Rulebook</a> be a guiding light&mdash;and also let us organize the toy chest as fastidiously as
					possible. Printed errors in the CSRD should be corrected, and vestigial text omitted. Any
					significant alterations should include a rationale for those changes.</p>
				<h5 id="about-embrace-community-and-designer-wisdom" class="og-csrd-header-small">Embrace Community and
					Designer Wisdom<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#about-embrace-community-and-designer-wisdom"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Editor's notes should draw upon the experiences of people who have spent years running and teaching
					the Cypher System (like the fine folks of the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WQYRWhn">Cypher
						Unlimited Discord Server</a>). Valuable blog posts from <a
						href="https://www.montecookgames.com/category/all-news/game-better/">Monte Cook Games' "Game

				<p>This is a living document, and corrections will need to be made in the future. If ever Monte Cook
					Games expands the CSRD further, that new content should be incorporated that content into this
					document accordingly.</p>

					<span class="og-csrd-chapter">Chapter 3</span>
					How to Play the Cypher System
				</h3>
				<p>This chapter provides a brief explanation of how to play the game, and it's useful for learning the
					game. Once you understand the basic concepts, you'll likely want to reference <a
						href="#chapter-11-rules-of-the-game">Chapter 11: Rules of the Game</a> for a more in-depth
					treatment.</p>
				<p>The Cypher System uses a twenty-sided die (1d20) to determine the results of most actions. Whenever a
					roll of any kind is called for and no die is specified, roll a d20.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The game master (GM) sets a difficulty for any given task. There are ten
					degrees of difficulty. Thus, the difficulty of a task can be rated on a scale of 1 to 10.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each difficulty has a target number associated with it. The target number is
					always three times the task's difficulty, so a difficulty 1 task has a target number of 3, but a
					difficulty 4 task has a target number of 12. To succeed at the task, you must roll the target number
					or higher. See the <a href="#running-task-difficulty">Task Difficulty</a> table for guidance in how
					this works.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Character <a href="#skills">skills</a>, favorable circumstances, or excellent
					equipment can decrease the difficulty of a task. For example, if a character is trained in climbing,
					they turn a difficulty 6 climb into a difficulty 5 climb. This is called easing the difficulty by
					one step (or just easing the difficulty, which assumes it's eased by one step). If they are
					specialized in climbing, they turn a difficulty 6 climb into a difficulty 4 climb. This is called
					easing the difficulty by two steps. Decreasing the difficulty of a task can also be called easing a
					task. Some situations increase, or hinder, the difficulty of a task. If a task is hindered, it
					increases the difficulty by one step.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A skill is a category of knowledge, ability, or activity relating to a task,
					such as climbing, geography, or persuasiveness. A character who has a skill is better at completing
					related tasks than a character who lacks the skill. A character's level of skill is either trained
					(reasonably skilled) or specialized (very skilled).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you are trained in a skill relating to a task, you ease the difficulty of
					that task by one step. If you are specialized, you ease the difficulty by two steps. A skill can
					never decrease a task's difficulty by more than two steps.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Anything else that reduces difficulty (help from an ally, a particular piece
					of equipment, or some other advantage) is referred to as an <a
						href="#modifying-the-difficulty-assets">asset</a>. Assets can never decrease a task's difficulty
					by more than two steps.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You can also decrease the difficulty of a given task by applying <a
						href="#effort">Effort</a>.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Effort is described in more detail in <a href="#chapter-11-rules-of-the-game">Chapter 11: Rules
							of the Game</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">To sum up, three things can decrease a task's difficulty: skills, assets, and
					Effort.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you can ease a task so its difficulty is reduced to 0, you automatically
					succeed and don't need to make a roll.</p>

					<p>The rules of the Cypher System are quite straightforward at their heart, as all of gameplay is
						based around a few core concepts.</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Game master (GM)</dt>
						<dd>The player who doesn't run a character, but instead guides the flow of the story and runs
							all the NPCs.</dd>
						<dt>Nonplayer character (NPC)</dt>
						<dd>Characters run by the GM. Think of them as the minor characters in the story, or the
							villains or opponents. This includes any kind of creature as well as people.</dd>
						<dt>Party</dt>
						<dd>A group of player characters (and perhaps some NPC allies).</dd>
						<dt>Player character (PC)</dt>
						<dd>A character run by a player rather than the GM. Think of the PCs as the main characters in
							the story.</dd>
						<dt>Player</dt>
						<dd>The players who run characters in the game.</dd>
						<dt>Session</dt>
						<dd>A single play experience. Usually lasts a few hours. Sometimes one adventure can be
							accomplished in a session. More often, one adventure is multiple sessions.</dd>
						<dt>Adventure</dt>
						<dd>A single portion of the campaign with a beginning and an end. Usually defined at the
							beginning by a goal put forth by the PCs and at the end by whether or not they achieve that
							goal.</dd>
						<dt>Campaign</dt>
						<dd>A series of sessions strung together with an overarching story (or linked stories) with the
							same player characters. Often, but not always, a campaign involves a number of adventures.
						</dd>
						<dt>Character</dt>
						<dd>Anything that can act in the game. Although this includes PCs and human NPCs, it also
							technically includes creatures, aliens, mutants, automatons, animate plants, and so on. The
							word "creature" is usually synonymous.</dd>
					</dl>

				<h4 id="how-to-play-when-do-you-roll">When Do You Roll?<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#how-to-play-when-do-you-roll" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Any time your character attempts a task, the GM assigns a difficulty to that task, and you roll a d20
					against the associated target number.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When you jump from a burning vehicle, swing an axe at a mutant beast, swim
					across a raging river, identify a strange device, convince a merchant to give you a lower price,
					craft an object, use a power to control a foe's mind, or use a blaster rifle to carve a hole in a
					wall, you make a d20 roll.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">However, if you attempt something that has a difficulty of 0, no roll is
					needed&mdash;you automatically succeed. Many actions have a difficulty of 0. Examples include
					walking across the room and opening a door, using a special ability to negate gravity so you can
					fly, using an ability to protect your friend from radiation, or activating a device (that you
					already understand) to erect a force field. These are all routine actions and don't require rolls.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Using skill, assets, and Effort, you can ease the difficulty of potentially
					any task to 0 and thus negate the need for a roll. Walking across a narrow wooden beam is tricky for
					most people, but for an experienced gymnast, it's routine. You can even ease the difficulty of an
					attack on a foe to 0 and succeed without rolling.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If there's no roll, there's no chance for failure. However, there's also no
					chance for remarkable success (in the Cypher System, that usually means rolling a 19 or 20, which
					are called special rolls; <a href="#chapter-11-rules-of-the-game">Chapter 11: Rules of the Game</a>
					also discusses special rolls).</p>

						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Making an <a href="#rules-action-attack">attack</a> in combat works the same way as any other roll:
					the GM assigns a difficulty to the task, and you roll a d20 against the associated target number.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The difficulty of your attack roll depends on how powerful your opponent is.
					Just as tasks have a difficulty from 1 to 10, creatures have a level from 1 to 10. Most of the time,
					the difficulty of your attack roll is the same as the creature's level. For example, if you attack a
					level 2 bandit, it's a level 2 task, so your target number is 6.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It's worth noting that <a href="#rules-the-player-always-rolls">players make
						all die rolls</a>. If a character attacks a creature, the player makes an attack roll. If a
					creature attacks a character, the player makes a <a href="#action-defend">defense roll</a>.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The damage dealt by an attack is not determined by a roll&mdash;it's a flat
					number based on the weapon or attack used. For example, a spear always does 4 points of damage.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Your <a href="#rules-armor">Armor</a> characteristic reduces the damage you
					take from attacks directed at you. You get Armor from wearing <a href="#equipment-armor">physical
						armor</a> (such as a <a href="#contemporary-armor-leather-jacket">leather jacket</a> in a modern
					game or chainmail in a fantasy setting) or from special abilities. Like weapon damage, Armor is a
					flat number, not a roll. If you're attacked, subtract your Armor from the damage you take. For
					example, a leather jacket gives you +1 to Armor, meaning that you take 1 less point of damage from
					attacks. If a mugger hits you with a knife for 2 points of damage while you're wearing a leather
					jacket, you take only 1 point of damage. If your Armor reduces the damage from an attack to 0, you
					take no damage from that attack.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When you see the word "Armor" capitalized in the game rules (other than in the
					name of a special ability), it refers to your Armor characteristic&mdash;the number you subtract
					from incoming damage. When you see the word "armor" with a lowercase "a," it refers to any physical
					armor you might wear.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Typical physical <a href="#equipment-weapons">weapons</a> come in three
					categories: light, medium and heavy.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Light weapons</strong> inflict only 2 points of damage, but they ease attack rolls
							because they are fast and easy to use. Light weapons are punches, kicks, clubs, knives,
							handaxes, rapiers, small pistols, and so on. Weapons that are particularly small are light
							weapons.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Medium weapons</strong> inflict 4 points of damage. Medium weapons include swords,
							battleaxes, maces, crossbows, spears, pistols, blasters, and so on. Most weapons are medium.
							Anything that could be used in one hand (even if it's often used in two hands, such as a
							quarterstaff or spear) is a medium weapon.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Heavy weapons</strong> inflict 6 points of damage, and you must use two hands to
							attack with them. Heavy weapons are huge swords, great hammers, massive axes, halberds,
							heavy crossbows, blaster rifles, and so on. Anything that must be used in two hands is a
							heavy weapon.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 id="how-to-play-special-rolls">Special Rolls<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#how-to-play-special-rolls" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>When you roll a natural 19 (the d20 shows "19") and the roll is a success, you also have a <a
						href="#special-rolls-minor-effect">minor effect</a>. In combat, a minor effect inflicts 3
					additional points of damage with your attack, or, if you'd prefer a special result, you could decide
					instead that you knock the foe back, distract them, or something similar. When not in combat, a
					minor effect could mean that you perform the action with particular grace. For example, when jumping
					down from a ledge, you land smoothly on your feet, or when trying to persuade someone, you convince
					them that you're smarter than you really are. In other words, you not only succeed but also go a bit
					further.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When you roll a natural 20 (the d20 shows "20") and the roll is a success, you
					also have a <a href="#special-rolls-major-effect">major effect</a>. This is similar to a minor
					effect, but the results are more remarkable. In combat, a major effect inflicts 4 additional points
					of damage with your attack, but again, you can choose instead to introduce a dramatic event such as
					knocking down your foe, stunning them, or taking an extra action. Outside of combat, a major effect
					means that something beneficial happens based on the circumstance. For example, when climbing up a
					cliff wall, you make the ascent twice as fast. When a roll grants you a major effect, you can choose
					to use a minor effect instead if you prefer.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In combat (and only in combat), if you roll a natural 17 or 18 on your attack
					roll, you add 1 or 2 additional points of damage, respectively. Neither roll has any special effect
					options&mdash;just the extra damage.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Rolling a natural 1 is always bad. It means that the GM introduces a new
					complication into the encounter.</p>

							At most, immediate distance is 10 feet (3 m).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Short distance</strong> is anything greater than immediate distance but less than 50
							feet (15 m) or so.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Long distance</strong> is anything greater than short distance but less than 100 feet
							(30 m) or so.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Very long distance</strong> is anything greater than long distance but less than 500
							feet (150 m) or so. Beyond that range, distances are always specified&mdash;1,000 feet (300
							m), a mile (1.5 km), and so on.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The idea is that it's not necessary to measure precise distances. Immediate
					distance is right there, practically next to the character. Short distance is nearby. Long distance
					is farther off. Very long distance is really far off.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">All weapons and special abilities use these terms for ranges. For example, all
					melee weapons have immediate range&mdash;they are close-combat weapons, and you can use them to
					attack anyone within immediate distance. A thrown knife (and most other thrown weapons) has short
					range. A bow has long range. An <A href="#type-adept">Adept</a>'s <a
						href="#ability-onslaught">Onslaught</a> ability also has short range.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character can <a href="#action-move">move</a> an immediate distance as part
					of another action. In other words, they can take a few steps over to the control panel and activate
					a switch. They can lunge across a small room to attack a foe. They can open a door and step through.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character can move a short distance as their entire action for a turn. They
					can also try to move a long distance as their entire action, but the player might have to roll to
					see if the character slips, trips, or stumbles as the result of moving so far so quickly.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, if the PCs are fighting a group of cultists, any character can
					likely attack any cultist in the general melee&mdash;they're all within immediate range. Exact
					positions aren't important. Creatures in a fight are always moving, shifting, and jostling, anyway.
					However, if one cultist stayed back to fire a pistol, a character might have to use their entire
					action to move the short distance required to attack that foe. It doesn't matter if the cultist is
					20 feet (6 m) or 40 feet (12 m) away&mdash;it's simply considered short distance. It does matter if
					the cultist is more than 50 feet (15 m) away because that distance would require a long or very long
					move.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Many rules in this system avoid the cumbersome need for precision. Does it really matter if the
						ghost is 13 feet away from you or 18? Probably not. That kind of needless specificity only slows
						things down and draws away from, rather than contributes to, the story.</p>

				<p><a href="#chapter-12-experience-points">Experience points (XP)</a> are rewards given to players when
					the GM intrudes on the story (this is called <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a>) with a new
					and unexpected challenge. For example, in the middle of combat, the GM might inform the player that
					they drop their weapon. However, to intrude in this manner, the GM must award the player 2 XP. The
					rewarded player, in turn, must immediately give one of those XP to another player and justify the
					gift (perhaps the other player had a good idea, told a funny joke, performed an action that saved a
					life, and so on).</p>
				<p>Alternatively, the player can refuse the GM intrusion. If they do so, they don't get the 2 XP from
					the GM, and they must also spend 1 XP that they already have. If the player has no XP to spend, they
					can't refuse the intrusion.</p>
				<p>The GM can also give players XP between sessions as a reward for making discoveries during an
					adventure. Discoveries are interesting facts, wondrous secrets, powerful artifacts, answers to
					mysteries, or solutions to problems (such as where the kidnappers are keeping their victim or how

				<h4 id="character-stats">Character Stats<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#character-stats"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Every player character has three defining characteristics, which are typically called "statistics" or
					"stats." These stats are Might, Speed, and Intellect. They are broad categories that cover many
					different but related aspects of a character.</p>
				<h5 id="might">Might<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#might" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Might defines how strong and durable your character is. The concepts of strength, endurance,
					constitution, hardiness, and physical prowess are all folded into this one stat. Might isn't
					relative to size; instead, it's an absolute measurement. An elephant has more Might than the
					mightiest tiger, which has more Might than the mightiest rat, which has more Might than the
					mightiest spider.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Might governs actions from forcing doors open to walking for days without food
					to resisting disease. It's also the primary means of determining how much damage your character can
					sustain in a dangerous situation. Physical characters, tough characters, and characters interested
					in fighting should focus on Might.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Might could be thought of as Might/Health because it governs how strong you are and how much
						physical punishment you can take.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="speed">Speed<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#speed" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Speed describes how fast and physically coordinated your character is. The stat embodies quickness,
					movement, dexterity, and reflexes. Speed governs such divergent actions as dodging attacks, sneaking
					around quietly, and throwing a ball accurately. It helps determine whether you can move farther on
					your turn. Nimble, fast, or sneaky characters will want good Speed stats, as will those interested
					in ranged combat.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Speed could be thought of as Speed/Agility because it governs your overall swiftness and
						reflexes.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="intellect">Intellect<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#intellect" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>This stat determines how smart, knowledgeable, and likable your character is. It includes
					intelligence, wisdom, charisma, education, reasoning, wit, willpower, and charm. Intellect governs
					solving puzzles, remembering facts, telling convincing lies, and using mental powers. Characters
					interested in communicating effectively, being learned scholars, or wielding supernatural powers
					should stress their Intellect stat.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Intellect could be thought of as Intellect/Personality because it governs both intelligence and
						charisma.</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="pool-edge-and-effort">Pool, Edge, and Effort<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#pool-edge-and-effort" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Each of the three stats has two components: Pool and Edge. Your Pool represents your raw, innate
					ability, and your Edge represents knowing how to use what you have. A third element ties into this
					concept: Effort. When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you apply Effort.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Your stat Pools, as well as your Effort and Edge, are determined by the character type,
						descriptor, and focus that you choose. Within those guidelines, however, you have a lot of
						flexibility in how you develop your character.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="pool">Pool<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#pool" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Your Pool is the most basic measurement of a stat. Comparing the Pools of two creatures will give you
					a general sense of which creature is superior in that stat. For example, a character who has a Might
					Pool of 16 is stronger (in a basic sense) than a character who has a Might Pool of 12. Most
					characters start with a Pool of 9 to 12 in most stats&mdash;that's the average range.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When your character is injured, sickened, or attacked, you temporarily lose
					points from one of your stat Pools. The nature of the attack determines which Pool loses points. For
					example, physical damage from a sword reduces your Might Pool, a poison that makes you clumsy
					reduces your Speed Pool, and a psionic blast reduces your Intellect Pool. You can also spend points
					from one of your stat Pools to decrease a task's difficulty (see Effort, below). You can rest to
					recover lost points from a stat Pool, and some special abilities or cyphers might allow you to
					recover lost points quickly.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-ednote pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Editor's Notes</strong> &mdash; If you lose Pool points due to using <a
							href="#chapter-9-abilities">abilities</a> or taking <a href="#rules-damage">damage</a>, you
						can recover points in a pool with a <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="edge">Edge<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#edge" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Although your Pool is the basic measurement of a stat, your Edge is also important. When something
					requires you to spend points from a stat Pool, your Edge for that stat reduces the cost. It also
					reduces the cost of applying Effort to a roll.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, let's say you have a mental blast ability, and activating it
					costs 1 point from your Intellect Pool. Subtract your Intellect Edge from the activation cost, and
					the result is how many points you must spend to use the mental blast. If using your Edge reduces the
					cost to 0, you can use the ability for free.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Your Edge can be different for each stat. For example, you could have a Might
					Edge of 1, a Speed Edge of 1, and an Intellect Edge of 0. You'll always have an Edge of at least 1
					in one stat. Your Edge for a stat reduces the cost of spending points from that stat Pool, but not
					from other Pools. Your Might Edge reduces the cost of spending points from your Might Pool, but it
					doesn't affect your Speed Pool or Intellect Pool. Once a stat's Edge reaches 3, you can apply one
					level of Effort for free.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character who has a low Might Pool but a high Might Edge has the potential
					to perform Might actions consistently better than a character who has a Might Edge of 0. The high
					Edge will let them reduce the cost of spending points from the Pool, which means they'll have more
					points available to spend on applying Effort.</p>
				<h5 id="effort">Effort<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#effort" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you can apply Effort. For a beginning
					character, applying Effort requires spending 3 points from the stat Pool appropriate to the action.
					Thus, if your character tries to dodge an attack (a Speed roll) and wants to increase the chance for
					success, you can apply Effort by spending 3 points from your Speed Pool. Effort eases the task by
					one step. This is called applying one level of Effort.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You don't have to apply Effort if you don't want to. If you choose to apply
					Effort to a task, you must do it before you attempt the roll&mdash;you can't roll first and then
					decide to apply Effort if you rolled poorly.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Applying more Effort can lower a task's difficulty further: each additional
					level of Effort eases the task by another step. Applying one level of Effort eases the task by one
					step, applying two levels eases the task by two steps, and so on. However, each level of Effort
					after the first costs only 2 points from the stat Pool instead of 3. So applying two levels of
					Effort costs 5 points (3 for the first level plus 2 for the second level), applying three levels
					costs 7 points (3 plus 2 plus 2), and so on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Every character has an Effort score, which indicates the maximum number of
					levels of Effort that can be applied to a roll. A beginning (first-tier) character has an Effort of
					1, meaning you can apply only one level of Effort to a roll. A more experienced character has a
					higher Effort score and can apply more levels of Effort to a roll. For example, a character who has
					an Effort of 3 can apply up to three levels of Effort to reduce a task's difficulty.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When you apply Effort, subtract your relevant Edge from the total cost of
					applying Effort. For example, let's say you need to make a Speed roll. To increase your chance for
					success, you decide to apply one level of Effort, which will ease the task. Normally, that would
					cost 3 points from your Speed Pool. However, you have a Speed Edge of 2, so you subtract that from
					the cost. Thus, applying Effort to the roll costs only 1 point from your Speed Pool.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">What if you applied two levels of Effort to the Speed roll instead of just
					one? That would ease the task by two steps. Normally, it would cost 5 points from your Speed Pool,
					but after subtracting your Speed Edge of 2, it costs only 3 points.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Once a stat's Edge reaches 3, you can apply one level of Effort for free. For
					example, if you have a Speed Edge of 3 and you apply one level of Effort to a Speed roll, it costs
					you 0 points from your Speed Pool. (Normally, applying one level of Effort would cost 3 points, but
					you subtract your Speed Edge from that cost, reducing it to 0.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Skills and other advantages also ease a task, and you can use them in
					conjunction with Effort. In addition, your character might have special abilities or equipment that
					allow you to apply Effort to accomplish a special effect, such as knocking down a foe with an attack
					or affecting multiple targets with a power that normally affects only one.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>When applying Effort to melee attacks, you have the option of spending points from either your
						Might Pool or your Speed Pool. When making ranged attacks, you may spend points only from your
						Speed Pool. This reflects that with melee you sometimes use brute force and sometimes use
						finesse, but with ranged attacks, it's always about careful targeting.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="og-csrd-ednote pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Editor's Notes</strong> &mdash; A few abilities give you a <a
							href="#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a> (these usually require you
						to apply at least one level of Effort to a task). In effect, you're getting one more level of
						Effort than what you paid for. This free level of Effort can exceed the Effort limit for your
						character, but not the six-step limit for easing a task.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="effort-and-damage">Effort and Damage<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#effort-and-damage"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Instead of applying Effort to ease your attack, you can apply Effort to increase the amount of damage
					you inflict with an attack. For each level of Effort you apply in this way, you inflict 3 additional
					points of damage. This works for any kind of attack that inflicts damage, whether a sword, a
					crossbow, a mind blast, or something else.</p>
				<p>When using Effort to increase the damage of an area attack, such as the explosion created by an <a
						href="#type-adept">Adept</a>'s <a href="#ability-concussion">Concussion</a> ability, you inflict
					2 additional points of damage instead of 3 points. However, the additional points are dealt to all
					targets in the area. Further, even if one or more of the targets resist the attack, they still take
					1 point of damage.</p>
				<h5 id="multiple-uses-of-effort-and-edge">Multiple Uses of Effort and Edge<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#multiple-uses-of-effort-and-edge" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>If your Effort is 2 or higher, you can apply Effort to multiple aspects of a single action. For
					example, if you make an attack, you can apply Effort to your attack roll and apply Effort to
					increase the damage.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The total amount of Effort you apply can't be higher than your Effort score.
					For example, if your Effort is 2, you can apply up to two levels of Effort. You could apply one
					level to an attack roll and one level to its damage, two levels to the attack and no levels to the
					damage, or no levels to the attack and two levels to the damage.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You can use Edge for a particular stat only once per action. For example, if
					you apply Effort to a Might attack roll and to your damage, you can use your Might Edge to reduce
					the cost of one of those uses of Effort, not both. If you spend 1 Intellect point to activate your
					mind blast and one level of Effort to ease the attack roll, you can use your Intellect Edge to
					reduce the cost of one of those things, not both.</p>
				<h5 id="stat-examples">Stat Examples<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#stat-examples"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>A beginning character is fighting a giant rat. The PC stabs their spear at the rat, which is a level
					2 creature and thus has a target number of 6. The character stands atop a boulder and strikes
					downward at the beast, and the GM rules that this helpful tactic is an asset that eases the attack
					by one step (to difficulty 1). That lowers the target number to 3. Attacking with a spear is a Might
					action; the character has a Might Pool of 11 and a Might Edge of 0. Before making the roll, they
					decide to apply a level of Effort to ease the attack. That costs 3 points from their Might Pool,
					reducing the Pool to 8. But the points are well spent. Applying the Effort lowers the difficulty
					from 1 to 0, so no roll is needed&mdash;the attack automatically succeeds.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Another character is attempting to convince a guard to let them into a private
					office to speak to an influential noble. The GM rules that this is an Intellect action. The
					character is third tier and has an Effort of 3, an Intellect Pool of 13, and an Intellect Edge of 1.
					Before making the roll, they must decide whether to apply Effort. They can choose to apply one, two,
					or three levels of Effort, or apply none at all. This action is important to them, so they decide to
					apply two levels of Effort, easing the task by two steps. Thanks to their Intellect Edge, applying
					the Effort costs only 4 points from their Intellect Pool (3 points for the first level of Effort
					plus 2 points for the second level minus 1 point for their Edge). Spending those points reduces
					their Intellect Pool to 9. The GM decides that convincing the guard is a difficulty 3 (demanding)
					task with a target number of 9; applying two levels of Effort reduces the difficulty to 1 (simple)
					and the target number to 3. The player rolls a d20 and gets an 8. Because this result is at least
					equal to the target number of the task, they succeed. However, if they had not applied some Effort,
					they would have failed because their roll (8) would have been less than the task's original target
					number (9).</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="character-tiers">Character Tiers<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#character-tiers"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Every character starts the game at the first tier. Tier is a measurement of power, toughness, and
					ability. Characters can advance up to the sixth tier. As your character advances to higher tiers,
					you gain more abilities, increase your Effort, and can improve a stat's Edge or increase a stat.
					Generally speaking, even first-tier characters are already quite capable. It's safe to assume that
					they've already got some experience under their belt. This is not a "zero to hero" progression, but
					rather an instance of competent people refining and honing their capabilities and knowledge.
					Advancing to higher tiers is not really the goal of Cypher System characters, but rather a
					representation of how characters progress in a story.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">To progress to the next tier, characters earn experience points (XP) by
					pursuing <a href="#character-arcs">character arcs</a>, going on adventures, and discovering new
					things&mdash;the system is about both discovery and exploration, as well as achieving personal
					goals. Experience points have many uses, and one use is to purchase character benefits. After your
					character purchases four character benefits, they advance to the next tier. Each benefit costs 4 XP,
					and you can purchase them in any order, but you must purchase one of each kind of benefit (and then
					advance to the next tier) before you can purchase the same benefit again. The four character
					benefits are as follows.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Increasing Capabilities:</strong> You gain 4 points to add to your stat Pools. You
							can allocate the points among the Pools however you wish.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Moving Toward Perfection:</strong> You add 1 to your Might Edge, your Speed Edge, or
							your Intellect Edge (your choice).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Extra Effort:</strong> Your Effort score increases by 1.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Skills:</strong> You become trained in one skill of your choice, other than attacks
							or defense. As described in <a href="#chapter-11-rules-of-the-game">Chapter 11: Rules of the
								Game</a>, a character trained in a skill treats the difficulty of a related task as one
							step lower than normal. The skill you choose for this benefit can be anything you wish, such
							as climbing, jumping, persuading, or sneaking. You can also choose to be knowledgeable in a
							certain area of lore, such as history or geology. You can even choose a skill based on your
							character's special abilities. For example, if your character can make an Intellect roll to
							blast an enemy with mental force, you can become trained in using that ability, easing the
							task of using it. If you choose a skill that you are already trained in, you become
							specialized in that skill, easing related tasks by two steps instead of one.</p>

					example, you might say, "I am a <a href="#descriptor-rugged">Rugged</a> <a

					am a <a href="#descriptor-charming">Charming</a> <a href="#type-explorer">Explorer</a> who <a
						href="#focus-focuses-mind-over-matter">Focuses Mind Over Matter</a>."</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In this sentence, the adjective is called your <a
						href="#chapter-7-descriptor">descriptor</a>.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The noun is your character <a href="#chapter-5-type">type</a>.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The verb is called your <a href="#chapter-8-focus">focus</a>.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Even though character type is in the middle of the sentence, that's where
					we'll start this discussion. (Just as in a sentence, the noun provides the foundation.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Your character type is the core of your character. In some roleplaying games,
					it might be called your character class. Your type helps determine your character's place in the
					world and relationship with other people in the setting. It's the noun of the sentence "I am an
					adjective noun who verbs."</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You can choose from four character types: <a
						href="#type-warrior">Warriors</a>, <a href="#type-adept">Adepts</a>, <a
						href="#type-explorer">Explorers</a>, and <a href="#type-speaker">Speakers</a>.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Your descriptor defines your character&mdash;it colors everything you do. Your
					descriptor places your character in the situation (the first adventure, which starts the campaign)
					and helps provide motivation. It's the adjective of the sentence "I am an adjective noun who verbs."
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Unless your GM says otherwise, you can choose from any of the character
					descriptors.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Focus is what your character does best. Focus gives your character specificity
					and provides interesting new abilities that might come in handy. Your focus also helps you
					understand how you relate with the other player characters in your group. It's the verb of the
					sentence "I am an adjective noun who verbs."</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">There are many character foci. The ones you choose from will probably depend
					on the setting and genre of your game.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">

				<h4 id="special-abilities">Special Abilities<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#special-abilities"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Character types and foci grant PCs special abilities at each new tier. Using these abilities usually
					costs points from your stat Pools; the cost is listed in parentheses after the ability name. Your
					Edge in the appropriate stat can reduce the cost of the ability, but remember that you can apply
					Edge only once per action. For example, let's say an <a href="#type-adept">Adept</a> with an
					Intellect Edge of 2 wants to use their <a href="#ability-onslaught">Onslaught</a> ability to create
					a bolt of force, which costs 1 Intellect point. They also want to increase the damage from the
					attack by using a level of Effort, which costs 3 Intellect points. The total cost for their action
					is 2 points from their Intellect Pool (1 point for the bolt of force, plus 3 points for using
					Effort, minus 2 points from their Edge).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes the point cost for an ability has a + sign after the number. For
					example, the cost might be given as "2+ Intellect points." That means you can spend more points or
					more levels of Effort to improve the ability further, as explained in the ability description.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Many special abilities grant a character the option to perform an action that
					they couldn't normally do, such as projecting rays of cold or attacking multiple foes at once. Using
					one of these abilities is an action unto itself, and the end of the ability's description says
					"Action" to remind you. It also might provide more information about when or how you perform the
					action.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some special abilities allow you to perform a familiar action&mdash;one that
					you can already do&mdash;in a different way. For example, an ability might let you wear heavy armor,
					reduce the difficulty of Speed defense rolls, or add 2 points of fire damage to your weapon damage.
					These abilities are called enablers. Using one of these abilities is not considered an action.
					Enablers either function constantly (such as being able to wear heavy armor, which isn't an action)
					or happen as part of another action (such as adding fire damage to your weapon damage, which happens
					as part of your attack action). If a special ability is an enabler, the end of the ability's
					description says "Enabler" to remind you.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some abilities specify a duration, but you can always end one of your own
					abilities anytime you wish.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Because the Cypher System covers so many genres, not all of the descriptors, types, and foci

				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You could choose a skill that incorporates more than one of these areas
					(interacting might include deceiving, intimidation, and persuasion) or that is a more specific
					version of one (hiding might be sneaking when you're not moving). You could also make up more
					general professional skills, such as baker, sailor, or lumberjack. If you want to choose a skill
					that's not on this list, it's probably best to run it past the GM first, but in general, the most
					important thing is to choose skills that are appropriate to your character.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Remember that if you gain a skill that you're already trained in, you become
					<a href="#key-concepts">specialized</a> in that skill. Because skill descriptions can be nebulous,
					determining whether you're trained or specialized might take some thinking. For example, if you're
					trained in lying and later gain an ability that grants you skill with all social interactions, you
					become specialized in lying and trained in all other types of interactions. Being trained three
					times in a skill is no better than being trained twice (in other words, specialized is as good as it
					gets).
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Only skills gained through character type abilities or other rare instances
					allow you to become skilled with attack or defense tasks.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you gain a special ability through your type, your focus, or some other
					aspect of your character, you can choose it in place of a skill and become trained or specialized in
					that ability. For example, if you have a mind blast, when it's time to choose a skill to be trained
					in, you can select your mind blast as your skill. That would ease the attack every time you used it.
					Each ability you have counts as a separate skill for this purpose. You can't select "all mind
					powers" or "all spells" as one skill and become trained or specialized in such a broad category.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In most campaigns, fluency in a language is considered a skill. So if you want
					to speak French, that's the same as being trained in biology or swimming.</p>

						to think of a skill as falling into one the following three categories in relation to the game

					<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
						<li>
							<p><strong>General Skills</strong> are broadly applicable to huge number of possible tasks,

								considered a general skill—you can make all kinds of things out of all kinds of
								different metals.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Specific Skills</strong> are skills that are less broadly applicable, and might
								build upon a general skill. "Negotiation" might be a specialization of positive social
								interaction in a <a href="#chapter-15-science-fiction">science fiction</a> game, and
								"elven weaponsmithing" might be a specialization of "metalworking" in a <a

								arc. Later, with the GM's approval, they might specialize in "elven weaponsmithing"
								(using the <a href="#crafting-magic-items">crafting magic items</a> rules).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Detailed Knowledge</strong> skills might be unique to the game world, with only a
								certain few that possess them. The GM might decide that any skill for which an
								unpreparedness is a hindrance qualifies. As a result, PCs are assumed to have with these

				<p>Character type is the core of your character. Your type helps determine your character's place in the

					adjective noun who verbs."</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>In some roleplaying games, your character type might be called your character class.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You can choose from four character types: Warrior, Adept, Explorer, and
					Speaker. However, you may not want to use these generic names for them. This chapter offers a few
					more specific names for each type that might be more appropriate to various genres. You'll find that
					names like "Warrior" or "Explorer" don't always feel right, particularly in games set in modern
					times. As always, you're free to do as you wish.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Your type is who your character is. You should use whatever name you want for your type, as long
						as it fits both your character and the setting.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Since the type is the basis upon which your whole character is built, it's
					important to consider how the type relates to the chosen setting. To help with this, types are
					actually general archetypes. A <a href="#type-warrior">Warrior</a>, for example, might be anyone
					from a knight in shining armor to a cop on the streets to a grizzled cybernetic veteran of a
					thousand futuristic wars.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">To further massage the four types for better use in various settings,
					different methods called flavors are presented in <a href="#chapter-6-flavor">Chapter 6: Flavor</a>
					to help slightly tailor the types toward fantasy, science fiction, or other genres (or to address
					different character concepts).</p>

					<p>A player intrusion is the player choosing to alter something in the campaign, making things
						easier for a player character. Conceptually, it is the reverse of a <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM
							intrusion</a>: instead of the GM giving the player XP and introducing an unexpected
						complication for a character, the player spends 1 XP and presents a solution to a problem or
						complication. What a player intrusion can do usually introduces a change to the world or current
						circumstances rather than directly changing the character. For instance, an intrusion indicating
						that the cypher just used still has an additional use would be appropriate, but an intrusion
						that heals the character would not. If a player has no XP to spend, they can't use a player
						intrusion.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">A few player intrusion examples are provided under each type. That said,
						not every player intrusion listed there is appropriate for all situations. The GM may allow
						players to come up with other player intrusion suggestions, but the GM is the final arbiter of
						whether the suggested intrusion is appropriate for the character's type and suitable for the
						situation. If the GM refuses the intrusion, the player doesn't spend the 1 XP, and the intrusion
						doesn't occur.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Using an intrusion does not require a character to use an action to
						trigger it. A player intrusion just happens.</p>

							title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
					<p>Ray wants to create a Warrior character for a modern campaign. He decides that the character is
						an ex-military fellow who is fast and strong. He puts 3 of his additional points into his Might
						Pool and 3 into his Speed Pool; his stat Pools are now Might 13, Speed 13, and Intellect 8. As a
						first-tier character, his Effort is 1, his Might Edge is 1, and his Speed Edge and Intellect
						Edge are both 0. His character is not particularly smart or charismatic.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">He wants to use a large combat knife (a medium weapon that inflicts 4
						points of damage) and a .357 Magnum (a heavy pistol that inflicts 6 points of damage but
						requires the use of both hands). Ray decides not to wear armor, as it's not really appropriate
						to the setting, so for his first ability, he chooses <a
							href="#ability-trained-without-armor">Trained Without Armor</a> so he eases Speed defense
						actions. For his second ability, he chooses <a href="#ability-combat-prowess">Combat Prowess</a>
						so he can inflict extra damage with his big knife.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Ray wants to be fast as well as tough, so he selects <a
							href="#ability-improved-edge">Improved Edge</a>. This gives him a Speed Edge of 1. He rounds
						out his character with <a href="#ability-physical-skills">Physical Skills</a> and chooses
						swimming and running.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">The Warrior can bear two cyphers. The GM decides that Ray's first cypher
						is a pill that restores 6 points of Might when swallowed, and his second is a small, easily
						concealed grenade that explodes like a firebomb when thrown, inflicting 3 points of damage to
						all within immediate range.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Ray still needs to choose a descriptor and a focus. Looking ahead to the
						descriptor rules, Ray chooses <a href="#descriptor-strong">Strong</a>, which increases his Might
						Pool to 17. He also becomes trained in jumping and breaking inanimate objects. (If he had chosen
						jumping as one of his physical skills, the Strong descriptor would have made him specialized in
						jumping instead of trained.) Being Strong also gives Ray an extra medium or heavy weapon. He
						chooses a baseball bat that he'll use in a pinch. He keeps it in the trunk of his car.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">For his focus, Ray chooses <a href="#focus-masters-weaponry">Masters
							Weaponry</a>. This gives him yet another weapon of high quality. He chooses another combat
						knife and asks the GM if he could use it in his left hand&mdash;not to make attacks, but as a
						shield. This will ease his Speed defense rolls if he has both knives out (the "shield" counts as
						an asset). The GM agrees. During the game, Ray's Warrior will be hard to hit&mdash;he is trained
						in Speed defense rolls, and his extra knife eases his defense rolls by another step.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Thanks to his focus, he also inflicts 1 additional point of damage with
						his chosen weapon. Now he inflicts 6 points of damage with his blade. Ray's character is a
						deadly combatant, likely starting the game with a reputation as a knife fighter.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">For his character arc, Ray chooses <a href="#arc-defeat-a-foe">Defeat a
							Foe</a>. That foe, he decides, is none other than someone in his company who was once a
						friend but went rogue.</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Group Role:</strong> Adepts are not powerful in straightforward combat, although they
							often wield abilities that provide excellent combat support, both offensively and
							defensively. They sometimes possess abilities that facilitate overcoming challenges. For
							example, if the group must get through a locked door, an Adept might be able to destroy it
							or teleport everyone to the other side.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Societal Role:</strong> In settings where the supernatural is rare, strange, or

					<p>Adepts are almost always emblematic of the paranormal or superhuman in some way&mdash;wizards,

						a "utility belt" full of oddments. Or a game like that might not have Adepts. That's okay too.

					<p>Jen wants to create an Adept&mdash;a sorcerer for a fantasy campaign. She decides to be somewhat
						well rounded, so she puts 2 of her additional points into each stat Pool, giving her a Might
						Pool of 9, a Speed Pool of 11, and an Intellect Pool of 14. Her Adept is smart and quick. She
						has an Intellect Edge of 1, a Might Edge of 0, and a Speed Edge of 0. As a first-tier character,
						her Effort is 1. As her initial abilities, she chooses <a
							href="#ability-onslaught">Onslaught</a> and <a href="#ability-ward">Ward</a>, giving her a
						strong offense and defense. She also chooses <a href="#ability-magic-training">Magic
							Training</a> and rounds out her character with <a href="#ability-scan">Scan</a>, which she
						hopes will be useful in gaining insight and information. For this character, Onslaught, Ward,
						and Scan are all spells she has mastered through years of training and study.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">She can bear three cyphers. The GM gives her a potion that acts as a
						short-range teleporter, a small charm that restores 5 points to her Intellect Pool, and a
						fluid-filled flask that explodes like a fiery bomb. Jen's sorcerer is skilled with light
						weapons, so she chooses a dagger.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">For her descriptor, Jen chooses <a
							href="#descriptor-graceful">Graceful</a>, which adds 2 points to her Speed Pool, bringing it
						to 13. That descriptor means she is trained in balancing and anything requiring careful
						movements, physical performing arts, and Speed defense tasks. Perhaps she is a dancer. In fact,
						she begins to develop a backstory that involves graceful, lithe movements that she incorporates
						into her spells.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">For her focus, she chooses <a href="#focus-leads">Leads</a>. This gives
						her training in social interactions, which again helps round her out&mdash;she's good in all
						kinds of situations. Moreover, she has the <a href="#ability-good-advice">Good Advice</a>
						ability, which enables her to be a focal point of her group.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Her spells and focus abilities cost Intellect points to activate, so she's
						glad to have a lot of points in her Intellect Pool. In addition, her Intellect Edge will help
						reduce those costs. If she uses her Onslaught force blast without applying Effort, it costs 0
						Intellect points and deals 4 points of damage. Her Intellect Edge will allow her to save points
						to devote toward applying Effort for other purposes, perhaps to boost the accuracy of Onslaught.
					</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">For her character arc, Jen chooses <a href="#arc-aid-a-friend">Aid a
							Friend</a>. She decides that when her sorcerer character was young, she had a magical
						mentor. That mentor was later taken prisoner by a demon, so her character is always looking for
						clues on how to find the demon and release her friend from bondage.</p>

					<p>GMs are always free to pre-select a type's special abilities at a given tier to reinforce the

							Training</a> as one of their tier 1 abilities. This doesn't make the character any less
						powerful or special, but it says something about her role in the world and expectations in the

					<p>Sam decides to create an Explorer character for a science fiction campaign. This character will
						be a hardy soul who explores alien worlds. They put 3 additional points into their Might Pool, 2
						into their Speed Pool, and 1 into their Intellect Pool; their stat Pools are now Might 13, Speed
						11, and Intellect 10. As a first-tier character, their Effort is 1, their Might Edge is 1, and
						their Speed Edge and Intellect Edge are 0. Their character is fairly well-rounded so far.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sam immediately leaps in and starts choosing abilities. They pick <a
							href="#ability-danger-sense">Danger Sense</a> and <a
							href="#ability-surging-confidence">Surging Confidence</a>, thinking those abilities will be
						generally useful. They also choose <a href="#ability-practiced-in-armor">Practiced in Armor</a>,
						reasoning that the character wears high-tech medium armor when exploring. Last, they choose <a
							href="#ability-knowledge-skills">Knowledge Skills</a> and select geology and biology to help
						during interplanetary explorations.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sam's Explorer can bear two cyphers, which in this setting involve
						nanotechnology. The GM decides that one is a nanite injector that grants a +1 bonus to Might
						Edge when used, and the other is a device that can create one simple handheld object the user
						wishes.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sam's Explorer is not really geared toward fighting, but sometimes the
						universe is a dangerous place, so they note that they're carrying a medium blaster as well.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sam still needs a descriptor and a focus. Looking to the Descriptor
						chapter, they choose <a href="#descriptor-hardy">Hardy</a>, which increases their Might Pool to
						17. They also heal more quickly and can operate better when injured. They're trained in Might
						defense but have an <a href="#key-concepts">inability</a> with <a
							href="#rules-encounters-rounds-and-initiative">initiative</a>; however, it's effectively
						canceled out by their Danger Sense (and vice versa). Sam could go back and select something else
						instead of Danger Sense, but they like it and decide to keep it. Overall, the descriptor ends up
						making the character tough but a little slow.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">For their focus, Sam chooses <a
							href="#focus-explores-dark-places">Explores Dark Places</a> (in this case, weird ruins of
						alien civilizations). This gives the character a bunch of additional skills: searching,
						listening, climbing, balancing, and jumping. They're quite the capable Explorer.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">For their character arc, Sam chooses <a
							href="#arc-enterprise">Enterprise</a>. Exploring alien places sometimes turns up strange
						relics, and Sam figures they might be able to set up a service to reliably transport these items
						to responsible third parties, rather than allow them to fall into the hands of pirates and rich
						private collectors. For a small fee, of course.</p>

						<p><strong>Group Role:</strong> The Speaker is often the face of the group, serving as the

						Speed 12, and Intellect 14. As a first-tier character, her Effort is 1, her Might Edge and Speed
						Edge are 0, and her Intellect Edge is 1. She's smart and charismatic but not particularly tough.
					</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Mary chooses <a href="#ability-fast-talk">Fast Talk</a> and <a

					<p class="og-csrd-indent">A Speaker normally starts with two cyphers, but the GM rules that

						background. Mary's cypher is an odd pocket watch given to her by her grandfather. She doesn't

						three rounds.</p>

						actions and gains an extra <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a> each day. At first, Mary

				<p>The following aspects of the four character types can be modified at character creation. Other
					abilities should not be changed.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Stat Pools:</strong> Each character type has a starting stat Pool value. A player can
							exchange points between their Pools on a one-for-one basis. For example, they can trade 2
							points of Might for 2 points of Speed. However, no starting stat Pool should be higher than
							20.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Edge:</strong> A player can start with an Edge of 1 in whichever stat they wish.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Cypher Use:</strong> If a character gives up the ability to bear one cypher, they
							gain an additional skill of their choice.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Some types have static first-tier abilities that let them use
							light, medium, and/or heavy weapons without a penalty. Warriors can use all weapons,
							Explorers can use light and medium weapons, and Adepts and Speakers can use light weapons.
							Any one of these weapon abilities can be sacrificed to gain training in a different skill of
							the player's choice.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="drawbacks-and-penalties">Drawbacks and Penalties<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#drawbacks-and-penalties" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>In addition to other customization options, a player can choose to take drawbacks or penalties to
					gain further advantages.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> A weakness is, essentially, the opposite of Edge. If you have a
							weakness of 1 in Speed, all Speed actions that require you to spend points cost 1 additional
							point from your Pool. At any time, a player can give their character a weakness in one stat
							and, in exchange, gain +1 to their Edge in one of the other two stats. So a PC can take a
							weakness of 1 in Speed to gain +1 to their Might Edge.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Normally, you can have a weakness only in a stat in which you have an
							Edge of 0. Further, you can't have more than one weakness, and you can't have a weakness
							greater than 1 unless the additional weakness comes from another source (such as a disease
							or disability arising from actions or conditions in the game).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Inabilities:</strong> <a href="#key-concepts">Inabilities</a> are like negative
							skills. They make one type of task harder by hindering it. If a character chooses to take an
							inability, they gain a skill of their choice. Normally, a character can have only one
							inability unless the additional inability comes from another source (such as a descriptor or
							a disease or disability arising from actions or conditions in the game).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h3 id="chapter-6-flavor">
					<span class="og-csrd-chapter">Chapter 6</span>
					Flavor
				</h3>
				<p>Flavors are groups of special abilities the GM and players can use to alter a character type to make
					it more to their liking or more appropriate to the genre or setting. For example, if a player wants
					to create a magic-using thief character, she could play an Adept with stealth flavoring. In a
					science fiction setting, a Warrior might also have knowledge of machinery, so the character could be
					flavored with technology.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">At a given tier, abilities from a flavor are traded one for one with standard
					abilities from a type. So to add the Danger Sense stealth flavor ability to a Warrior, something
					else&mdash;perhaps <a href="#ability-bash">Bash</a>&mdash;must be sacrificed. Now that character can
					choose Danger Sense as they would any other first-tier warrior ability, but they can never choose
					Bash.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The GM should always be involved in flavoring a type. For example, they might
					know that for their science fiction game, they want a type called a "Glam," which is a <a
						href="#type-speaker">Speaker</a> flavored with certain technology abilities&mdash;specifically
					those that make the character a flamboyant starship pilot. Thus, they exchange the first-tier
					abilities <a href="#ability-spin-identity">Spin Identity</a> and <a
						href="#ability-inspire-aggression">Inspire Aggression</a> for the <a
						href="#flavor-technology">technology flavor</a> abilities <a
						href="#ability-datajack">Datajack</a> and <a href="#ability-tech-skills">Tech Skills</a> so the
					character can plug into the ship directly and can take piloting and computers as skills.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In the end, flavor is mostly a tool for the GM to easily create
					campaign-specific types by making a few slight alterations to the four base types. Although players
					may wish to use flavors to get the characters they want, remember that they can also shape their PCs
					with descriptors and foci very nicely.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The flavors available are <a href="#flavor-stealth">stealth</a>, <a
						href="#flavor-technology">technology</a>, <a href="#flavor-magic">magic</a>, <a
						href="#flavor-combat">combat</a>, and <a href="#flavor-skills-and-knowledge">skills and

					Descriptor
				</h3>
				<p>Your descriptor defines your character&mdash;it flavors everything you do. The differences between a
					Charming Explorer and a Vicious Explorer are considerable. The descriptor changes the way those
					characters go about every action. Your descriptor places your character in the situation (the first
					adventure, which starts the campaign) and helps provide motivation. It is the adjective of the
					sentence "I am an adjective noun who verbs."</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Descriptors offer a one-time package of extra abilities, skills, or
					modifications to your stat Pools. Not all of a descriptor's offerings are positive character
					modifications. For example, some descriptors have <a
						href="#key-concepts">inabilities</a>&mdash;tasks that a character isn't good at. You can think
					of inabilities as negative skills&mdash;instead of being one step better at that kind of task,
					you're one step worse. If you become skilled at a task that you have an inability with, they cancel
					out. Remember that characters are defined as much by what they're not good at as by what they are
					good at.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Descriptors also offer a few brief suggestions for how your character got
					involved with the rest of the group on their first adventure. You can use these, or not, as you
					wish.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This section details fifty descriptors. Choose one of them for your character.
					You can pick any descriptor you wish regardless of your type. At the end of this chapter, a few
					options are provided for <a href="#customizing-descriptors">Customizing Descriptors</a>, including
					making a character's species their descriptor.</p>

				<h4 id="customizing-descriptors">Customizing Descriptors<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#customizing-descriptors" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Under the normal rules, each descriptor is based on some modification of the following guidelines:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Some descriptors offer +4 to one stat Pool and either two narrow skills or one broad skill.</li>
					<li>Other descriptors offer +2 to one stat Pool and either three narrow skills or one narrow skill
						and one broad skill.</li>
					<li>A broad skill covers many areas (such as all interactions). A narrow skill covers fewer areas
						(such as deceptive interactions). Combat-related skills, such as defense or <a
							href="#rules-encounters-rounds-and-initiative">initiative</a>, are considered broad skills
						in this sense.</li>
					<li>Regardless, you can add an additional skill if it is balanced by an <a
							href="#key-concepts">inability</a>.</li>
					<li>You can add other non-skill abilities by eyeballing them and trying to equate them to the value
						of a skill, if possible. If the descriptor seems lacking, add a moderately priced item as
						additional equipment to balance things out.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>With this general information, you can customize a descriptor, but keep in mind that a heavily
					customized descriptor isn't a descriptor if it no longer says one thing about a character. It's
					better to use this information to create a new descriptor that fits exactly how the player wants to
					portray the character.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="species-as-descriptor">Species as Descriptor<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#species-as-descriptor" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Sometimes, in settings that have alien or fantasy species, players want to play a member of that
					species rather than the default (which is usually "human"). Most of the time, this choice is one of
					flavor rather than game mechanics. If you're a 7-foot-tall furry Rigellian with three eyes, that's
					great, but it doesn't change your stats or skills (though it may have roleplaying challenges).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">However, sometimes being a nonhuman results in more substantive changes. A PC
					ogre in a fantasy setting might have the Strong or Tough descriptor, or perhaps it has a descriptor
					simply called Ogre, which is similar to Strong or Tough but more pronounced (with greater Might but
					even greater drawbacks). This would mean that instead of being a Tough Warrior who Controls Beasts,
					the character is an Ogre Warrior who Controls Beasts.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><a href="#part-3-genres">Part 3: Genres</a> offers a few species descriptors,
					but many GMs will want to create their own as suits their setting. It can't be stressed enough,
					however, that nine times out of ten, in most genres, species differences aren't significant enough
					to warrant this treatment. The differences between a Mysterious character and a Virtuous one are
					probably greater than those between an Alpha Centauran and an Earthling.</p>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">
					<h5 class="og-csrd-header-small" id="variant-rule-two-descriptors">Variant Rule: Two Descriptors<a
							class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#variant-rule-two-descriptors" title="Permalink"

					<p>In many <a href="#chapter-13-fantasy">fantasy</a> or <a
							href="#chapter-15-science-fiction">science fiction</a> settings, a species descriptor can
						take the place of a character's descriptor. However, this creates a situation where only human
						characters have the variability of choosing a descriptor that suits their personality. The GM
						might instead allow all human characters to have two descriptors, and nonhuman characters to
						have a standard descriptor in addition to their species descriptor.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes contradictory descriptors might weaken or negate each other's
						benefits and drawbacks. If one descriptor gives training in a skill and another gives an <a
							href="#key-concepts">inability</a> in that skill, they cancel each other out and the
						character doesn't have any modifier for that skill at all.</p>

					<p>If a player wants to play a nearly human species without any exceptional or unique special
						abilities, it's easy for a GM to pick an appropriate descriptor and use it as that species'

					<span class="og-csrd-chapter">Chapter 8</span>
					Focus
				</h3>
				<p>Focus is what makes a character unique. No two PCs in a group should have the same focus. A focus
					gives a character benefits when they create their character and each time they ascend to the next
					tier. It's the verb of the sentence "I am an adjective noun who verbs."</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This chapter contains nearly a hundred sample foci, such as <a
						href="#focus-bears-a-halo-of-fire">Bears a Halo of Fire</a>, <a
						href="#focus-would-rather-be-reading">Would Rather Be Reading</a>, and <a
						href="#focus-pilots-starcraft">Pilots Starcraft</a>. These foci can be chosen and used as
					presented by a player, or by the GM who adds them to a list of available foci for their players in
					their next campaign.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In addition, the latter half of this chapter provides tools for the GM or an
					enterprising player to create their own custom foci that perfectly match the needs of a given game
					or campaign, as presented in <a href="#focus-creating-new-foci">Creating New Foci</a>.</p>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">

				<h4 id="focus-choosing-foci">Choosing Foci<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#focus-choosing-foci"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Not all foci are appropriate for every genre. <a href="#part-3-genres">Part 3: Genres</a> provides
					guidance, but this section offers some broad generalizations. Obviously, the GM can include whatever
					foci are available in their setting. Foci end up being an important distinction in this case,
					because <a href="#focus-commands-mental-powers">Commands Mental Powers</a>, for example, makes it
					clear that psychic abilities exist in the setting, just as Howls at the Moon implies the existence
					of lycanthropes like werewolves, and Pilots Starcraft, of course, requires starships available to
					pilot.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When a focus is chosen for a character, they get a special connection to one
					or more of their fellow PCs, a first-tier ability, and perhaps additional starting equipment: one or
					two pieces of equipment that might be required for the character to use their ability, or that might
					pair well with the focus. For instance, a character that can build things needs a set of tools. A
					character that's constantly on fire needs a set of clothes that are immune to flame. A character
					that draws runes to cast spells needs writing implements. A character that slays monsters with a
					sword needs a sword. And so on. That said, many foci don't require additional equipment.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each focus also offers one or more suggestions&mdash;GM intrusions&mdash;for
					possible effects or consequences of really good or really bad die rolls.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A couple of foci presented in this chapter provide a "type swap option" that
					allows a player to swap an ability that would otherwise be gained from their type for the indicated
					ability instead. A player doesn't have to make the swap; they merely have the option. For instance,
					the focus Loves the Void provides the option to gain the ability Have Spacesuit, Will Travel instead
					of a type ability.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As a character progresses to a new tier, a focus grants more abilities. Each
					tier's benefit is usually labeled Action or Enabler. If an ability is labeled Action, a character
					must take an action to use it. If an ability is labeled Enabler, it makes other actions better or
					gives some other benefit, but it's not an action. An ability that allows a character to blast foes
					with lasers is an action. An ability that grants additional damage when an attack is made is an
					enabler. An enabler is used in the same turn as another action, and often as part of another action.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each tier's benefits are independent of and cumulative with benefits from
					other tiers (unless indicated otherwise). So if a first-tier ability grants +1 to Armor and a
					fourth-tier ability also grants +1 to Armor, when the character reaches fourth tier, a total of +2
					to Armor is granted.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">At tier 3 and tier 6, the character is asked to choose one ability from the
					two options provided.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Finally, you can choose whether you want to expand the <a
						href="#focus-story-behind-the-focus">story behind the focus</a> (though that's not mandatory).
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="focus-focus-connections">Focus Connections<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#focus-focus-connections" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Choose a connection that goes well with the focus. If you're a GM choosing (or creating) one or more
					foci for your players, choose up to four of the following connections.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Pick one other PC. For reasons unknown to you, that character is completely immune to your focus
						abilities, whether you use them for help or for harm.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You knew of that character years ago, but you don't think they knew you.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You're always trying to impress them, but you're not sure why.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character has a habit that annoys you, but you're otherwise quite
						impressed with their abilities.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character shows potential in appreciating your particular paradigm,
						fighting style, or other</li>
					<li>focus-provided attribute. You would like to train them, but you're not necessarily qualified to
						teach (that's up to you), and they might not be interested (that's up to them).</li>
					<!--
		NOTE TO SELF: omit this unclear text
		Pick one other PC. If they are within immediate range when you're in a fight, sometimes they provide an asset, and sometimes they accidentally hinder your attack rolls (FIFTYPERCENT% chance either way, determined per fight).
		-->
					<li>Pick one other PC. You once saved their life, and they clearly feel indebted to you. You wish
						they didn't; it's just part of the job.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character recently mocked you in some fashion that really hurt your
						feelings. How you deal with this (if at all) is up to you.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character knows you have suffered at the hands of robotic entities in
						the past. Whether you hate robots now is up to you, which may affect your relationship with the
						character if they are friendly with robots or have robotic parts.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as
						children.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. In the past, they taught you a few tricks to use in a fight.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character doesn't seem to approve of your methods.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. Long ago, the two of you were on opposite sides of a fight. You won, though
						you "cheated" in their eyes (but from your perspective, all's fair in a fight). They may be
						ready for a rematch, though that's up to them.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You are always trying to impress that character with your skill, wit,
						appearance, or bravado. Perhaps they are a rival, perhaps you need their respect, or perhaps
						you're romantically interested in them.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You fear that character is jealous of your abilities and worry that it might
						lead to problems.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You accidentally caught them in a trap you set, and they had to get free on
						their own.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You were once hired to track down someone who was close to that character.
					</li>
					<li>Pick two PCs (preferably ones who are likely to get in the way of your attacks). When you miss
						with an attack and the GM rules that you struck someone other than your target, you hit one of
						these two characters.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You're not sure how or from where, but that character has a line on bottles
						of rare alcohol and can get them for you for half price.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You recently had a possession go missing, and you're becoming convinced that
						they took it. Whether or not they did is up to them.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They always seem to know where you are, or at least in what direction you are
						in relation to them.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. Seeing you use your focus abilities seems to trigger an unpleasant memory in
						that character. That memory is up to the other PC, although they may not be able to consciously
						recall it.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. Something about them interferes with your abilities. When they stand next to
						you, your focus abilities cost 1 additional point.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. Something about them complements your abilities. When they stand next to you,
						the first focus ability you use in any 24-hour period costs 2 fewer points.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You have known that character for a while, and they helped you gain control
						of your focus-related abilities.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. Sometime in that character's past, they had a devastating experience while
						attempting something that you do as a matter of course thanks to your focus. Whether they choose
						to tell you about it is up to them.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. Their occasional clumsiness and loud behavior irritate you.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while practicing, you accidentally hit them with an
						attack, wounding them badly. It is up to them to decide whether they resent or forgive you.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They owe you a significant amount of money.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while escaping a threat, you accidentally left that
						character to fend for themselves. They survived, but just barely. It is up to the player of that
						character to decide whether they resent you or have decided to forgive you.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. Recently, they accidentally (or perhaps intentionally) put you in a position
						of danger. You're fine now, but you're wary around them.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. From your perspective, they seem nervous around a specific idea, person, or
						situation. You would like to teach them how to be more comfortable with their fears (if they
						will let you).</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They called you a coward once.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character always recognizes you or your handiwork, whether you're in
						disguise or are long gone when they arrive on the scene.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You inadvertently caused an accident that put them into a sleep so deep they
						didn't wake for three days. Whether they forgive you or not is up to them.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You are pretty sure you are related in some fashion.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You accidentally learned something they were trying to keep a secret.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They are especially sensitive to the use of your flashier focus abilities,
						and occasionally they become dazzled for a few rounds, which hinders their actions.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They appear to have a treasured item that was once yours, but that you lost
						in a game of chance years ago.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. If it wasn't for you, that character would have failed a past test of mental
						achievement.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. Based on a couple of comments you've overheard, you suspect that they don't
						hold your area of training or favorite hobby in the highest regard.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC whose focus intertwines with yours. This odd connection affects them in some
						way. For example, if the character uses a weapon, your focus ability sometimes improves their
						attack in some fashion.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They are deathly afraid of heights. You would like to teach them how to be
						more comfortable with their feet off the ground. They must decide whether or not to take you up
						on your offer.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They are skeptical of your claims about something momentous that happened in
						your past. They might even attempt to discredit you or discover the "secret" behind your story,
						though that's up to them.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They have a knack for being able to recognize where your plans or schemes
						have a weak spot.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character's face is so intriguing to you in a way you don't understand
						that you sometimes find yourself sketching their likeness in the dirt or using some other medium
						you have access to.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. That character has an extra item of regular equipment you gave them, either
						something you made or an item you just wanted to give them. (They choose the item.)</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. They commissioned you to do a job for them. You've already been paid but
						haven't yet completed the job.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. You worked together in the past, and the job ended badly.</li>
					<li>Pick one other PC. While they stand next to you and use their action to concentrate on helping

				<h4 id="focus-story-behind-the-focus">Story Behind the Focus<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#focus-story-behind-the-focus" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>The foci in this book have been purposely stripped down to basics so they have the widest possible
					application across multiple genres. A single descriptive sentence or two summarizes each one. After
					you choose a focus, you have the option to expand its presentation by adding more story and
					description relevant to the world or to the character.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For instance, if you choose <a href="#focus-operates-undercover">Operates
						Undercover</a>, the summarizing description is "Under the guise of someone else, you seek to
					find answers the powerful do not want divulged." If you choose <a
						href="#focus-conducts-weird-science">Conducts Weird Science</a>, the summary is "Your
					preternatural insight and ability make you a scientist capable of amazing feats." These descriptions
					provide what you need to know to use the focus.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">However, if you wish (and only if you wish; there is no requirement to do so),
					you can add more to those descriptions in a fashion that's relevant for your game. For example, if
					you choose both Operates Undercover and Conducts Weird Science for use in a modern genre such as
					horror, urban fantasy, espionage, or something similar, you might expand the descriptions as shown
					in the following examples.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Operates Undercover:</strong> Espionage is not something you know anything about. At
							least, that's what you want everyone to believe, because in truth, you've been trained as a
							spy or covert agent. You might work for a government or for yourself. You might be a police
							detective or a criminal. You could even be an investigative reporter.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Regardless, you learn information that others attempt to keep secret.
							You collect rumors and whispers, stories and hard-won evidence, and you use that knowledge
							to aid your own endeavors and, if appropriate, provide your employers with the information
							they desire. Alternatively, you might sell what you have learned to those willing to pay a
							premium.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">You probably wear dark colors&mdash;black, charcoal grey, or midnight
							blue&mdash;to help blend into the shadows, unless the cover you've chosen requires you to
							look like someone else.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Conducts Weird Science:</strong> You could be a respected scientist, having been
							published in several peer-reviewed journals. Or you might be considered a crank by your
							contemporaries, pursuing fringe theories on what others consider to be scant evidence. Truth
							is, you have a particular gift for sifting the edges of what's possible. You can find new
							insights and unlock odd phenomena with your experiments. Where others see a crackpot
							cornucopia, you sift the conspiracy theories for revelation. Whether you conduct your
							enquiries as a government contractor, a university researcher, a corporate scientist, or an
							indulger of curiosity in your own garage lab following your muse, you push the boundaries of
							what's possible.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">You probably care more about your work than trivialities such as your
							appearance, polite or proper behavior, or social norms, but then again, an eccentric like
							you might turn the tables on that stereotype too.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you want to go even further, you could determine where a character's focus abilities come from.
					Depending on the genre, they could derive those abilities from advanced and persistent training, via
					magical runes, through cybernetic parts, from their genetic heritage, or because of their access to
					advanced technology. For instance, a character might be able to blast targets with lightning because
					they got zapped by strange radiation or because they picked up a lightning gun. On the other hand,
					it might be because their intense training allowed them to learn lightning magic. The possibilities
					are nearly endless, and up to you to include or forgo. Because however a focus's abilities were
					gained, it's also enough that they just work.</p>

						href="#focus-creating-new-foci" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>This section provides everything you need to create your own foci.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Every focus has an overarching style, whether that's exploration, energy
					manipulation, or simply dealing a lot of damage in combat. These broad classifications are called
					focus categories.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each focus category has an overarching theme, followed by selection guidelines
					that describe how to choose abilities for each tier from the <a
						href="#chapter-9-abilities">Abilities</a> chapter, from tier 1 to tier 6.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The newly created focus should be named in the form of a verb, like <a
						href="#focus-controls-beasts">Controls Beasts</a> or <a href="#focus-abides-in-stones">Abides in
						Stone</a>. For instance, a fire-using focus created by following the guidelines in the energy
					manipulation focus category might be called <a href="#focus-bears-a-halo-of-fire">Bears a Halo of
						Fire</a> (one of the sample foci in this chapter). Alternatively, a new fire-using focus should
					get an all-new name like Stokes the Flames of the Apocalypse or Lights Fires With a Thought.</p>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#focus-choosing-abilities-by-relative-power"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The Ability Selection Guidelines invite you to choose an ability from one of three ranges: low tier,
					mid tier, and high tier. These ranges correspond with the power "grades" given for every ability.
					These abilities are further sorted into ability categories based on the kinds of things they
					do&mdash;abilities that improve physical attacks are in the attack skill category, abilities that
					assist allies are in the support category, and so on. Look for the grades and categories in the <a
						href="#ability-categories-and-relative-power">Ability Categories and Relative Power</a> section
					of <a href="#chapter-9-abilities">Chapter 9: Abilities</a>.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Low-tier abilities are best suited for focus options at tiers 1 and 2.
					Mid-tier abilities are best suited for focus options at tiers 3 and 4. High-tier abilities are best
					suited for focus options at tiers 5 and 6.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">That said, sometimes you'll find it appropriate to assign a low-tier ability
					at tier 3 or 4, or maybe a mid-tier ability at tier 1 or 2. Do so sparingly, but don't rule it out.
					It might be the only way to get all the abilities you want for the focus you're building.
					Higher-tier abilities usually cost more Pool points to use. So if a mid-tier ability is made
					available at tier 1 or 2, or a high-tier ability is made available at tier 3 or 4, the higher cost
					will be a balancing factor.</p>
				<h5 id="focus-balancing-abilities">Balancing Abilities<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#focus-balancing-abilities" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The guidelines within each category go a long way toward ensuring that the focus you build will be
					balanced. Sometimes it might be appropriate to grant a low-power ability along with a regular
					ability at a given tier, depending on the needs of the focus. A "low-power ability" is deliberately
					open for GM interpretation, but generally speaking, should be no more potent than a low-tier ability
					(that is, an ability that is normally available at tier 1 or 2).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For instance, someone who uses cold might be able to create small snow
					sculptures in addition to emitting a cold ray. Someone who uses electricity might be able to charge
					a depleted artifact or have an asset for dealing with electrical systems. And so on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Often, the focus guidelines note this as a possibility. However, you have
					great leeway in deciding if a focus needs an additional ability, even if the guidelines for that
					tier don't indicate one. If you do add an ability, or there is a higher-power ability at a tier that
					normally shouldn't have it, it might mean that the choice given at the next tier, or the previous
					tier, isn't quite as good. Balancing a focus is a bit of an art. Resist the urge to overpower the
					focus, but don't underpower it, either.</p>
				<h5 id="focus-ability-guidelines-are-not-prescriptive">Ability Guidelines are Not Prescriptive<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#focus-ability-guidelines-are-not-prescriptive"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Each focus category provides a guideline for what kind of ability you should select at every tier.
					But don't regard the guidelines as something that you can't vary. They're not prescriptive; they're
					just a place to start. You might want to vary the kind of ability at a particular tier that isn't
					indicated in the guidelines. As long as the chosen ability falls within the expected power curve for
					that tier, it's fine. The guideline isn't meant to be a straitjacket.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, if you're building a cold-using focus for a game set in a fantasy
					genre, you may decide that an ability that calls up a demon is a better choice at a particular tier
					than an ability that does damage in an area, which is what the tier 5 guideline for energy
					manipulation calls for. Making the change is probably especially valid if you call your new focus
					something like Channels the Ninth Circle.</p>
				<h5 id="focus-ability-swap">Ability Swap<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#focus-ability-swap"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>If you're creating a focus and you think it should provide a suite of abilities at first tier that
					would mechanically overload it, you have the option to add one as a "swap" ability. Doing so is as
					easy as allowing a character to swap out one of their type abilities for an indicated low-tier focus
					ability. The ability is gained instead of one of the abilities normally granted by the character's
					type.</p>
				<h5 id="focus-concept-and-category">Concept and Category<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#focus-concept-and-category" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Choosing to create a focus that uses a particular concept&mdash;say, creating illusions&mdash;doesn't
					lock you into creating a focus within a particular category&mdash;in this case, environment
					manipulation. A focus can be constructed in a variety of ways using a particular energy, tool, or
					concept, each ultimately leading to a focus that provides different results. It all depends on your
					ends. In this case, creating illusions might be used to sway others, which argues for a focus built
					using the influence category guidelines.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In the same way, if a focus grants a character the ability to call some kind
					of force or energy, that doesn't mean the focus should automatically be built using the energy
					manipulation category guidelines (though of course it could, if attacking and protecting yourself
					with that energy is the point). But a focus could be built that grants abilities to call energy or
					force that is primarily focused on durability, suggesting a tank combat focus (someone who can take
					a lot of punishment in a fight); or blasting away with a main concern for maximizing damage, thus
					suggesting a striker combat focus; or creating a <a href="#followers">follower</a> composed of that
					energy or force, suggesting an ally use focus (that is, someone who uses helping creatures, NPCs, or
					even duplicate versions of themselves to give them a leg up).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Here's another example: the focus Controls Gravity could conceivably be an
					environment manipulation focus or an energy manipulation focus. It depends on whether the focus is
					more concerned with crushing and holding things in place (environment manipulation) or on blasting
					things and protecting yourself with gravity (energy manipulation).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The same malleability of concept holds true in other realms. For instance, if
					someone is able to call up and mold raw earth, they might use it to transform themselves into a
					being of stone (tank combat), to batter foes (striker combat), or to create walls, barricades, and
					shields to protect their allies (support).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you're looking for an ability and can't seem to find the right one in the
					vast catalog in <a href="#chapter-9-abilities">Chapter 9: Abilities</a>, consider reskinning one to
					make it seem new (and to accomplish what you need). Reskinning means that you use the underlying
					mechanics of an ability as written but change the flavor in some fashion. For instance, maybe you're
					creating a new earth-moving focus but can't find enough earth-related abilities to meet your need.
					It's easy enough to change up other abilities so they use earth instead of fire, cold, or magnetism.
					For instance, Wings of Fire might become Wings of Earth, Ice Armor could become Earth Armor, and so
					on. These alterations change nothing except the type of damage and any knock-on effects (for
					instance, Wings of Earth might generate clouds of dust in their wake).</p>

					<p>Some abilities in <a href="#chapter-9-abilities">Chapter 9: Abilities</a> reference other
						abilities. If you select an ability for your focus or type that refers to or modifies a

				<h5 id="focus-creating-brand-new-abilities">Creating Brand-New Abilities<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#focus-creating-brand-new-abilities" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>You can go further than reskinning and create one or more brand-new abilities. When doing this, try
					to find something as close as possible to the effect you want, then use it as a template. In any
					case, deciding how much an ability should cost when it comes to a character's Pool is one of the
					most important aspects of getting an ability right.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You may notice that higher-tier abilities are more expensive. This is partly
					because they do more, but it's also because higher-tier characters have more Edge than lower-tier
					characters, which means they pay fewer points from their relevant Pools. A third-tier character with
					3 Edge in a relevant Pool pays no cost for abilities that cost 3 or fewer points. That's great for
					lower-tier abilities, but you'll usually want a character to think a little bit about how often to
					use their most powerful abilities. That means they should cost at least 1 point more than the Edge
					the character is likely to have at that tier. (Often, a character will have an Edge in their
					relevant Pool equal to their tier.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As a good rule of thumb, a typical ability should cost points equal to its
					tier.</p>
				<h5 id="focus-choose-gm-intrusions">Choose GM Intrusions<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"

					with the new focus being created, and assign it as a <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> for
					that focus. Of course, this often is done on the fly during the game. But giving the topic some
					thought while the focus is being constructed and the ideas are fresh in your head is likely to yield
					some particularly devilish options.</p>

				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Choose a low-tier ability that grants a level 2 NPC follower to the
							character, or gives a similar benefit provided by an NPC. Alternatively, lay the groundwork
							for gaining such NPC allies at higher tiers by choosing an ability that gives the character
							influence over others.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
							the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of
							knowledge or a related skill. For instance, training in a skill related to the kind of NPC
							follower the character gains would be appropriate.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Choose a low-tier ability that grants influence over similar kinds
							of NPCs as the follower gained at the previous tier. If no follower was gained at the
							previous tier, this ability should provide that benefit now.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes a secondary ability might be appropriate in addition to the
							ability provided above, perhaps a low-power ability that grants 2 or 3 points to a Pool.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the
							focus; a PC will choose one or the other.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">One option should be a mid-tier ability that improves the NPC follower
							previously provided (usually from level 2 to level 3) or grants an additional follower.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">The other option should be something that benefits the
							character&mdash;perhaps an offensive or defensive ability, or something that broadens their
							influence over their followers (or potential followers).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 4:</strong> Choose a mid-tier ability that gives the character an offensive or
							defensive capability if they haven't previously gained one, preferably within the theme of
							the focus. For instance, if the character gains followers because of their charisma, this
							ability might let them command foes for brief periods. If the character gains followers by
							building or calling them, this ability might let them affect entities of the same type that
							are not already their followers.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Alternatively, this ability might further improve a previously gained
							follower from level 3 to level 4, or grant an additional follower.</p>

					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 5:</strong> Choose an ability that improves the character by providing a
							defense, an improved stat Pool, or another kind of protection.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Alternatively, this ability could open a new front in influencing and
							calling NPC allies related to the focus's theme. For instance, someone who keeps beast
							allies might gain an ability to call a horde of lesser beasts. Someone who builds robots

				<p>Foci that allow a character to move objects, affect gravity, create objects (or illusions of
					objects), and so on are environment manipulation foci. Given that, in many cases, energy is used as
					part of this process, this category and energy manipulation overlap to some extent. Environment
					manipulation foci prioritize abilities that indirectly affect enemies and allies via objects,
					forces, and alterations of the surroundings; energy manipulation foci prioritize directly damaging
					targets with the chosen energy or force.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, rather than blasting a foe with a gravity pulse that does damage,
					a character using an environment manipulation focus based on gravity is more likely to have
					abilities that hold a target in place, use gravity to throw heavy objects as an attack, or lower
					gravity in a particular area or even on a particular object.</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Environment Manipulation Abilities:</strong> Foci themes that involve imagery or
							visible energies can affect the look of your type abilities. Such alterations, if any, do
							nothing but change the appearance of effects. If gravity is manipulated, perhaps a telltale
							bluish glow permeates all ability uses, including type abilities. If illusion is generated,
							perhaps flamboyant visual and auditory qualities accompany type abilities, such as the
							appearance of a tentacled beast holding a target in place when Stasis is used. And so on.

						<p class="og-csrd-indent">One option should be a mid-tier ability related to the focus's theme

						<p><strong>Tier 5:</strong> Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the environment-manipulation
							ability. For instance, if the focus-granted manipulation is illusory, this ability might
							haunt a target with terrifying images. If the focus is gravity based, it might unlock
							flight. If magnetic, it might allow the user to reshape metal. If the focus grants

				<p>Foci that allow a character to gather information, survive in unfamiliar environments, and find their

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Exploration foci rely on a variety of methods, though training and expertise

						<p><strong>Tier 4:</strong> Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages

							threaten), or a new or better form of offense.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 5:</strong> Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the movement-related ability.
							For instance, if the focus-provided movement is temporal, this ability might allow actual
							(if brief) jaunts of time travel. If the focus enhances speed, this ability might allow the
							character to move up to a very long distance with one action. And so on.</p>

						<p><strong>Tier 6:</strong> Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the

						<p class="og-csrd-indent">One of the options should provide either an offensive or a defensive
							ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier rather than mid tier).
						</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">The other option should be something that further explores the use of
							the basic movement ability. If the tier 5 choice was the penultimate ability, this might be

				<p>Striker combat foci prioritize dealing damage in battle over other concerns. Foci in this category
					offer defensive abilities as well, but they emphasize abilities that provide ways to spike damage to
					heights that other foci normally don't reach.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">To achieve this end, a striker combat focus might offer mastery of a
					particular style of martial combat, which could be training with a particular weapon or martial art,
					or the use of a unique tool (or even a kind of energy). A style might be something as singular as
					being the best at fighting a particular kind of enemy, or something much broader, such as adopting a
					particularly vicious or unsporting style. A striker combatant might use fire, force, or magnetism as
					their preferred method of spiking damage.</p>

						<p><strong>Connection:</strong> Choose four relevant connections from the <a

							5 poison for Fights Dirty or Murders, a trophy from a previously defeated foe for Battles
							Robots, or stylish clothes for Fights With Panache.</p>

					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Choose a low-tier ability that inflicts additional damage when a
							character attacks using the focus's particular fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when
							used against a chosen enemy.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
							the focus. For instance, a focus that grants proficiency in a special weapon might offer
							training in crafting tasks associated with that weapon. A focus that grants increased damage
							against a particular kind of foe might offer training in skills to recognize, locate, or
							just have general knowledge about that foe. A fighting style that involves fighting in a
							vicious or dirty manner might provide training in intimidation. And so on.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">If the focus is about fighting a particular enemy, additional
							secondary powers (more than might otherwise be offered) may be appropriate. Those either
							further enhance effectiveness against the chosen enemy, or offer broader but related
							abilities that give the character who takes the focus some functionality even when not
							fighting that enemy.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Choose a low-tier ability that provides some form of defense using
							the weapon, weapon style, or chosen energy. If the weapon style is being especially good at
							fighting a certain kind of foe, the ability should be a defense against that kind of foe.
							Alternatively, the focus might offer another method for increasing damage within the chosen
							paradigm.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate at tier 2. If
							so, choose whichever low-power ability wasn't gained at tier 1.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the
							focus; a PC will choose one or the other.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">One option should inflict additional damage when using the focus's
							fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy. That could be as
							simple as an ability that offers an additional attack of that kind.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">The other option should provide a method to temporarily neutralize a
							foe by disarming them, dazing or stunning them, slowing or holding them, or otherwise
							discombobulating them by using the focus's fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used
							against a chosen enemy.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 4:</strong> Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages
							provided by the focus's paradigm. Often, this includes training in a particular kind of
							attack. Alternatively, the ability might increase the advantages provided by achieving a
							certain combat status, such as gaining surprise.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 5:</strong> Choose a high-tier ability that inflicts damage. Alternatively, if
							focused on fighting a particular kind of foe, this ability might give the character a chance
							to completely neutralize, destroy, blind, or kill a singular target of up to level 3 (or
							higher, if the focus is on a singular foe).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 6:</strong> Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the
							focus; a PC will choose one or the other.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">One of the options should use the focus paradigm to inflict an
							exceptional amount of damage.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">The other option could be a different way of inflicting damage, either
							using the focus paradigm or just dealing lots of damage in general (and relying on previous
							focus tier abilities to improve targeting). This could be against multiple targets if the
							first option was for a single target, to outright kill or neutralize a target (starting with
							level 4, but with guidance for using Effort to increase the level of the target), or to
							select yet another foe, make another attack, or get away in order to fight another day.</p>

				<p>Foci that allow a character to help others succeed, defend others, heal others who are hurt, and so

					foci (such as Siphons Power) prioritize aiding, healing, and improving the character who takes the
					focus.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Support foci rely on a variety of methods to provide their help, including

					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Choose a low-tier ability that provides some form of defense, aid or

							could be to the PC and not to an ally, as one cannot protect another without first being
							able to protect themselves (and sometimes protecting themselves is the entire point).</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
							the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of

							that, by itself, wouldn't do much.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Choose a low-tier ability that follows up on the support style
							opened in the previous tier. If the previous tier's ability provided a means of protection
							only for the focus taker, this tier 2 ability should specifically provide aid to another. If
							the previous tier specifically provided aid to another, this tier 2 ability could defend the
							focus taker or provide an offensive capability grounded, if possible, in the focus's theme.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the
							focus; a PC will choose one or the other.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">One option should work within the focus's theme to aid, heal, protect,
							or otherwise help another.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">The other option should be something that benefits the character,
							either an offensive or defensive ability, or something that broadens their expertise in some
							fashion. Alternatively, it could be another, different method of helping someone else.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 4:</strong> Choose a mid-tier ability that gives an ally a direct boon or
							provides the character with a way to help another. It could also be an ability that harms or
							nullifies a foe, as removing foes certainly helps allies.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 5:</strong> Choose a high-tier ability that provides an offensive or defensive
							option for the character, if none have been provided yet. If this need has been previously
							addressed or is deemed unnecessary, choose a high-tier ability that provides some form of
							defense, aid or entertainment, benefit to recovery or healing, or protection to another. For
							example, a tier 5 ability might grant an ally an additional free action or allow them to
							repeat a failed action.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 6:</strong> Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the

				<p>Foci that prioritize being able to take a lot of punishment and soak up excess damage from foes fall
					within the tank combat category. These foci provide offensive abilities too, as well as additional
					abilities related to the particular method by which improved protection is achieved, but defensive
					abilities are most pronounced.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some tank combat foci involve a physical transformation that grants additional
					protection, and others rely on specialized training, use tools like shields or heavy armor, or
					provide the ability to heal incredibly fast. The kinds of physical transformation that a tank focus
					provides, if any, vary widely. A focus might turn a character's skin to stone, reinforce their body
					with metal, turn them into a monstrous being, make them so big it becomes harder to hurt them, and
					so on.</p>

				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Choose a low-tier ability that provides defense within the focus's
							theme. If the theme is simply intense training or the use of a defensive tool, the ability
							might be as simple as a bonus to Armor. If protection comes from physical transformation,
							this ability provides the base form effects, benefits, and in some cases drawbacks for
							making the transformation. A low-tier enhanced healing ability would also be appropriate at
							first tier.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
							the focus. If the character transforms, this ability may provide a knock-on effect, though
							in the case of some transformations, it might be a description of how someone with an
							abnormal physiognomy can fully heal. Other times, the secondary power may simply be training
							in a related skill, or it may unlock the ability to use a particular armor or shield without
							penalty.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> If the theme of the focus isn't physical transformation, choose a
							low-tier ability that provides an additional method of defending, healing damage, or
							avoiding attacks.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">If the theme of the focus is physical transformation, choose a
							low-tier ability that unlocks a new capability related to the form the character takes. That
							might mean gaining better control of the transformation, unlocking a robotic interface, or
							otherwise more fully unlocking that form. This ability is not necessarily defensive, though
							it could be.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the
							focus; a PC will choose one or the other.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">One option should provide an additional form of protection in keeping
							with the focus's theme, such as more defensive capabilities unlocked from a transformation
							(which might also come with additional offensive capabilities) or a simple physical
							enhancement if defense is gained by skills or enhanced healing.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">The other option should provide an offensive capability, especially if
							creating a non-transformation focus that doesn't already have offensive benefits. That
							capability could be an enhanced attack or provide some other benefit useful in combat, such
							as quickly evading or (on the other end of the continuum) becoming immovable.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 4:</strong> Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages
							provided by the focus's damage-soaking paradigm. Often, this includes training in a
							particular kind of defense. Alternatively, it might increase the advantages provided by
							previously unlocked defensive abilities, whether that means gaining greater control over a
							transformation, gaining additional chances to avoid damage or retry tasks related to
							enhanced determination, and so on. If the focus is lacking in offensive options, this is a
							good place to include one.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 5:</strong> Choose a high-tier ability that provides protection, possibly in the
							form of shrugging off a debilitating condition (including death). If the focus offers a
							physical transformation, this ability might further unlock an additional related ability,
							whether offensive, defensive, or something related to exploration or interaction (such as
							flight if the form is winged, intimidation if the form is fearsome, and so on).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tier 6:</strong> Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the
							focus; a PC will choose one or the other.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">One option should use the focus paradigm to increase the defense,
							protection, or ability to shrug off damage.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">The other option could be a different way of being defensive. In some
							cases, the best defense is a good offense, so this option could provide a high-tier
							offensive ability in keeping with the focus's theme, whether that's a straight-up damage
							boost on attacks or better control of an unstable physical transformation.</p>

				<p>This chapter presents a vast catalog of more than a thousand abilities a character can gain from
					their type, flavor (if any), and focus. They are sorted alphabetically by the ability's name.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character's type, flavor, and focus assign an appropriate tier to each
					ability. However, if you're creating a brand-new focus or type, we provide a couple of additional
					tools.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The first is a power grade for each ability, which tells you about how potent
					it is in relation to other abilities. Abilities appropriate for tiers 1 and 2 characters are called
					"low-tier" abilities. Abilities appropriate for tiers 3 and 4 are called "mid-tier" abilities.
					Abilities appropriate for tiers 5 and 6 are called "high-tier" abilities.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">These abilities are further sorted into ability categories based on the kinds
					of things they do&mdash;abilities that improve physical attacks are in the attack skill category,
					abilities that assist allies are in the support category, and so on.</p>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#ability-categories-and-relative-power" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Abilities can be divided into several categories based on the kinds of things they do&mdash;improve
					your physical attacks, assist allies, provide defense, give you a special attack form, and so on.
					Under each of the following category descriptions is a list of abilities that fit that category,
					sorted into low-, medium-, and high-tier abilities.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>It may be possible that a character gains the same ability from more than one source (such as
						from their type and their descriptor). Unless the two abilities are obviously additive (such as
						two abilities that each add 3 points to your Might Pool, which together would give the character
						+6 Might points), the duplicated ability might be improved in some way, such as having a longer
						duration or greater effect, or automatically providing an asset. Some abilities give suggestions
						on how to do this; otherwise, the player and the GM should work out whether and how the ability
						is improved.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The categories are mainly used by GMs when designing new foci for a campaign,
					allowing them to search a short list of abilities instead of trying to find something appropriate
					among the thousand or so abilities in this chapter. For example, the GM might have a custom focus in
					their campaign called "Is Born of the Swamp" and want a defensive ability for tier 5, so they can
					look at the high-tier abilities in the protection category and quickly narrow down what options are
					available.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>The ability categories are not intended to be rigid or comprehensive. Some abilities fall into
						more than one category, and it could be argued that some abilities could be included in more
						categories than are listed here.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">These categories have some overlap with the categories in the <a
							href="#chapter-8-focus">Focus</a> chapter. For example, there is a support category here and
						a support category in the <a href="#chapter-8-focus">Focus</a> chapter. They aren't intended to
						be exact parallels and they don't mean exactly the same thing. That said, if you're creating a
						support-centric focus, many of the abilities in the support ability category would be
						appropriate choices.</p>

					<li id="ability-a-smile-and-a-word">
						<p><strong>A Smile and a Word:</strong> When you use Effort on any action involving
							interactions&mdash;even those having to do with calming animals or communicating with
							someone or something whose language you do not speak&mdash;you gain a <a
								href="#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a> on the task. Action.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-able-assistance">
						<p><strong>Able Assistance:</strong> When you <a href="#cooperative-actions">help</a> someone
							with a task and they apply a level of Effort, they get a <a
								href="#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a> on that task. Enabler.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-absorb-energy">
						<p><strong>Absorb Energy (7 Intellect points):</strong> You touch an object and absorb its
							energy. If you touch a manifest cypher, you render it useless. If you touch an artifact,
							roll for its depletion. If you touch another kind of powered machine or device, the GM
							determines whether its power is fully drained. In any case, you absorb energy from the
							object touched and regain 1d10 Intellect points. If this would give you more Intellect than
							your Pool's maximum, the extra points are lost, and you must make a Might defense roll. The
							difficulty of the roll is equal to the number of points over your maximum you absorbed. If
							you fail the roll, you take 5 points of damage and are unable to act for one round. You can
							use this ability as a defense action when you're the target of an incoming ability. Doing so
							cancels the incoming ability, and you absorb the energy as if it were a device. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-absorb-kinetic-energy">
						<p><strong>Absorb Kinetic Energy:</strong> You absorb a portion of the energy of a physical
							attack or impact. You negate 1 point of damage you would have suffered and store that point
							as energy. Once you have absorbed 1 point of energy, you continue to negate 1 point of
							damage from any incoming blow or impact, but the residual energy bleeds off with a flare of
							harmless light (you cannot store more than 1 point at a time). Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-absorb-pure-energy">
						<p><strong>Absorb Pure Energy:</strong> When you use <a
								href="#ability-absorb-kinetic-energy">Absorb Kinetic Energy</a>, you can also absorb and
							store energy from attacks made with pure energy (focused light, radiation, transdimensional,
							psychic, etc.) or from conduits that direct energy, if you can make direct contact. This
							ability does not change how many points of energy you can store. If you also have Improved
							Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can absorb 2 points of damage from other energy sources as well.
							Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-accelerate">
						<p><strong>Accelerate (4+ Intellect points):</strong> Your words imbue the spirit of a character
							within immediate range who is able to understand you, accelerating them so they gain an
							asset on <a href="#rules-encounters-rounds-and-initiative">initiative</a> tasks and Speed
							defense rolls for ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
							choose to use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional
							target. You must speak to additional targets to accelerate them, one target per round.
							Action per target to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-acrobatic-attack">
						<p><strong>Acrobatic Attack (1+ Speed points):</strong> You leap into the attack, twisting or
							flipping through the air. If you roll a natural 17 or 18, you can choose to have a <a
								href="#special-rolls-minor-effect">minor effect</a> rather than deal extra damage. If
							you apply Effort to the attack, you get a <a href="#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free
								level of Effort</a> on the task. You can't use this ability if your Speed Effort costs
							are reduced from wearing armor. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-action-processor">
						<p><strong>Action Processor (4 Intellect points):</strong> Drawing upon stored information and
							the ability to process incoming data at amazing speeds, you are trained in one physical task
							of your choice for ten minutes. For example, you can choose running, climbing, swimming,
							Speed defense, or attacks with a specific weapon. Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-adaptation">
						<p><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Thanks to a latent mutation, a device implanted in your spine, a
							ritual performed with dragon's blood, or some other gift, you now remain at a comfortable
							temperature; never need to worry about dangerous radiation, diseases, or gases; and can
							always breathe in any environment (even the vacuum of space). Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-adroit-cypher-use">
						<p><strong>Adroit Cypher Use:</strong> You can bear four cyphers at a time. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-advanced-command">
						<p><strong>Advanced Command (7 Intellect points):</strong> A target within short range obeys any
							command you give as long as they can hear and understand you. Further, as long as you
							continue to do nothing but issue commands (taking no other action), you can give that same
							target a new command. This effect ends when you stop issuing commands or they are out of
							short range. Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-advantage-to-disadvantage">
						<p><strong>Advantage to Disadvantage (3 Speed points):</strong> With a number of quick moves,
							you make an attack against an armed foe, inflicting damage and disarming them so that their
							weapon is now in your hands or 10 feet (3 m) away on the ground&mdash;your choice. This
							disarming attack is hindered. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-advantages-of-being-big">
						<p><strong>Advantages of Being Big:</strong> When you use <a
								href="#ability-enlarge">Enlarge</a>, you're so big that you can move massive objects
							more easily, climb buildings by using hand- and footholds unavailable to regular-sized
							people, and jump much farther. While you enjoy the effects of Enlarge, all climbing,
							lifting, and jumping tasks are eased. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-advice-from-a-friend">
						<p><strong>Advice From a Friend (1 Intellect point):</strong> You know your friend's strengths
							and weaknesses, and how to motivate them to succeed. When you give an ally a suggestion
							involving their next action, the character is trained in that action for one round. Action.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-again-and-again">
						<p><strong>Again and Again (8 Speed points):</strong> You can take an additional action in a
							round in which you have already acted. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-agent-provocateur">
						<p><strong>Agent Provocateur:</strong> Choose one of the following to be trained in: attacking
							with a weapon of your choice, demolitions, or sneaking and lockpicking (if you choose this
							last option, you are trained in both). Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-aggression">
						<p><strong>Aggression (2 Might points):</strong> You focus on making attacks to such an extent
							that you leave yourself vulnerable to your opponents. While this ability is active, you gain
							an asset on your melee attacks, and your Speed defense rolls against melee and ranged
							attacks are hindered. This effect lasts for as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is
							taking place within range of your senses. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-agile-wit">
						<p><strong>Agile Wit:</strong> When attempting a Speed task, you instead can roll (and spend
							points) as if it were an Intellect action. If you apply Effort to this task, you can spend
							points from your Intellect Pool instead of your Speed Pool (in which case you also use your
							Intellect Edge instead of your Speed Edge). Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-all-out-con">
						<p><strong>All-Out Con (7 Intellect points):</strong> You put everything into it. You add three
							free levels of Effort to the next task you attempt. You can't use this ability again until
							after you've taken a ten-hour recovery action. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-alleviate">
						<p><strong>Alleviate (3 Intellect points):</strong> You attempt to cancel or cure one malady
							(such as disease or poison) in one creature. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-alley-rat">
						<p><strong>Alley Rat (6 Intellect points):</strong> While in a city, you find or create a
							significant shortcut, secret entrance, or emergency escape route where it looked like none
							existed. Doing so requires that you succeed on an Intellect action whose difficulty is set
							by the GM based on the situation. You and the GM should work out the details. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-amazing-effort">
						<p><strong>Amazing Effort:</strong> When you apply at least one level of Effort to a noncombat
							task, you get a <a href="#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">free level of Effort</a> on that
							task. When you choose this ability, decide if it applies to Might Effort or Speed Effort.
							Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-ambusher">
						<p><strong>Ambusher:</strong> When you attack a creature that has not yet acted during the first
							round of combat, your attack is eased. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-amplify-sounds">
						<p><strong>Amplify Sounds (2 Might points):</strong> For one minute, you can amplify distant or
							small sounds so that you can hear them clearly, even if it's a conversation or the sound of
							a small animal moving through an underground burrow up to a very long distance away. You can
							attempt to perceive the sound even if interceding barriers block it or the sound is very
							slight, though this requires a few additional rounds of concentration. To discriminate the
							sound you wish in a noisy environment might also require a few additional rounds of
							concentration as you audibly explore the surrounding soundscape. Given enough time, you
							could pinpoint every conversation, every breathing creature, and every device creating noise
							within range. Action to initiate, up to several rounds to complete, depending on the
							difficulty of the task.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-anecdote">
						<p><strong>Anecdote (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can lift the spirits of a group of
							creatures and help them bond together by entertaining them with an uplifting or pointed
							anecdote. For the next hour, those who pay attention to your story are trained in a task you
							choose that's related to the anecdote, as long as it's not an attack or defense task. Action
							to initiate, one minute to complete.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-animal-scrying">
						<p><strong>Animal Scrying (4+ Intellect points):</strong> If you know the general location of an
							animal that is friendly toward you and within 1 mile (1.5 km) of your location, you can
							sense through its senses for up to ten minutes. If you are not in animal form or not in a
							form similar to that animal, you must apply a level of Effort to use this ability. Action to
							establish.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-animal-shape">
						<p><strong>Animal Shape (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You change into an animal as small as a
							rat or up to your own size (such as a large dog or small bear) for ten minutes. Each time
							you transform, you can take a different animal shape. Your equipment becomes part of the
							transformation, rendering it unusable unless it has a passive effect, such as armor. In this
							form your stats remain the same as your normal form, but you can move and attack according
							to your animal shape (attacks from most animals this size are medium weapons, which you can
							use without penalty). Tasks requiring hands (such as using door handles or pushing buttons)
							are hindered when in animal form. You cannot speak but can still use abilities that don't
							rely on human speech. You gain two minor abilities associated with the creature you become
							(see the Animal Form Minor Abilities table at the end of the Character Abilities section of
							this document). For example, if you transform into a bat, you become trained in perception
							and can fly up to a long distance each round. If you transform into an octopus, you are
							trained in stealth and can breathe underwater. If you apply a level of Effort when you use
							this ability, you can either become a talking animal or take a hybrid shape. The talking
							animal shape looks exactly like a normal animal, but you can still talk and use any
							abilities that rely on human speech. The hybrid shape is like your normal form but with
							animalistic features, even if that animal is something much smaller than you (such as a bat
							or rat). In this hybrid form you can speak, use all of your abilities, make attacks like an
							animal, and perform tasks using hands without being hindered. Anyone who sees you clearly in
							this hybrid form would never mistake you for a mere animal. Action to change or revert.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">"Similar" is a broad term. Lions are similar to tigers and leopards,
							hawks are similar to ravens and swans, dogs are similar to wolves and foxes, and so on.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Even if your animal shape has multiple attack types (such as claws and
							bite), you can attack only once per round unless you have some other ability that lets you
							make additional attacks on your turn.</p>
						<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
							<p><em>Animal Shape variant:</em> If your character concept is that you always take the same
								animal form instead of being able to choose from multiple kinds of animals, double the
								duration of the Animal Shape ability (to twenty minutes per use). The GM may allow

						<p><strong>Apportation (4 Intellect points):</strong> You call a physical object to you. You can
							choose any piece of normal <a href="#chapter-10-equipment">equipment</a> on the standard
							equipment list, or (no more than once per day) you can allow the GM to determine the object
							randomly. If you call a random object, it has a 10 percent chance of being a manifest cypher

							chance of being a bit of worthless junk. You can't use this ability to take an item held by

						<p><strong>Arc Spray (3 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots
							without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow), you can
							fire your weapon at up to three targets (all next to one another) at once. Make a separate
							attack roll against each target. Each attack is hindered. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-arcane-flare">
						<p><strong>Arcane Flare (1 Intellect point):</strong> You enhance the damage of another attack
							spell with an extra charge of energy so that it deals 1 additional point of damage.
							Alternatively, you attack a target within long range by projecting a flare of raw magic that
							inflicts 4 points of damage. Enabler for enhancement; action for long-range attack.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-artifact-scavenger">
						<p><strong>Artifact Scavenger (6 Intellect points + 2 XP):</strong> You've developed a sixth
							sense for searching for the most valuable items in the wasteland. If you spend the time
							required to succeed on two scavenging tasks, you can exchange all the results you would
							otherwise obtain for a chance to gain an artifact of the GM's choosing if you succeed on a
							difficulty 6 Intellect task. You can use this ability at most once per day, and never within
							the same general area. Action to initiate, several hours to complete.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-artifact-tinkerer">
						<p><strong>Artifact Tinkerer:</strong> If you spend at least one day tinkering with an artifact

					</li>
					<li id="ability-as-foretold-in-prophecy">
						<p><strong>As Foretold in Prophecy:</strong> You accomplish something that proves you are truly

						<p><strong>As If One Creature:</strong> When you and your beast (from your <a

							distance of each other, you can share damage inflicted on either of you. For instance, if
							one of you is struck by a weapon for 4 points of damage, divide the damage between the two
							of you as you see fit. Only the Armor and resistances of the target initially damaged come
							into play. So if you have 2 Armor and are struck by a force blast for 4 points of damage,
							your beast can take the 2 points of damage you would suffer, but their Armor does not come
							into play, nor does their immunity to force blasts, if any. Enabler.</p>

					<li id="ability-assassin-skills">
						<p><strong>Assassin Skills:</strong> You are trained in stealth and disguise tasks. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-assassin-strike">

							Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-asserting-your-privilege">
						<p><strong>Asserting Your Privilege (3 Intellect points):</strong> Acting as only a privileged
							person can, you verbally harangue a foe who can hear and understand you so forcefully that
							they are unable to take any action, including attacks, for one round. Whether you succeed or
							fail, the next action the target takes is hindered. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-assume-control">
						<p><strong>Assume Control (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You control the actions of another
							creature you have interacted with or studied for at least a round. This effect lasts for ten
							minutes. The target must be level 2 or lower. Once you have assumed control, the target acts
							as if it wants to accomplish your desire to the best of its ability, freely using its own
							best judgment unless you use an action to give it a specific instruction on an
							issue-by-issue basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
							use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to attempt to command a level
							5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. When
							the effect ends, the target remembers everything that happened and reacts according to its
							nature and your relationship to it; assuming control might have soured that relationship if
							it was previously a positive one. Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-athlete">
						<p><strong>Athlete:</strong> You are trained in carrying, climbing, jumping, and smashing.
							Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-attack-and-attack-again">
						<p><strong>Attack and Attack Again:</strong> Rather than granting additional damage or a <a
								href="#special-rolls-minor-effect">minor</a> or <a

							attack roll allows you the option of immediately making another attack. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-attack-flourish">
						<p><strong>Attack Flourish:</strong> With your attack, you add stylish moves, entertaining
							quips, or a certain something that entertains or impresses others. One creature you choose
							within short range who can see you gains an asset to its next task if taken within a round
							or two. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-augment-cypher">
						<p><strong>Augment Cypher (2+ Intellect points):</strong> When you activate a cypher, add +1 to
							its level. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort
							to increase the level of the cypher by an additional +1 (per level of Effort applied). You
							can't increase the cypher's level above 10. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-autodoctor">
						<p><strong>Autodoctor:</strong> You are trained in healing, performing surgical procedures, and
							withstanding pain. You can perform surgeries on yourself, remaining conscious while you do
							so. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-awareness">
						<p><strong>Awareness (3 Intellect points):</strong> You become hyperaware of your surroundings
							in order to better locate your target. For ten minutes, you are aware of all living things
							within long range (including their general position), and by concentrating (another action),
							you can attempt to learn the general health and power level of any one of them. Action.</p>

					<li id="ability-battlefield-tactician">
						<p><strong>Battlefield Tactician (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You scrutinize your

							you might notice a pile of rubble you can stand on for an advantage in melee, a sheltered
							corner to help protect against enemy attacks, a less-slippery part of a frozen lake, or a
							place where the poison gas is thinner than elsewhere. If you (or someone you tell) move to
							that location, you (or they) gain an asset on tasks related to that optimal position (such
							as attack rolls from the high ground, Speed defense rolls from the sheltered corner, balance
							rolls on the frozen lake, or Might defense rolls against the poisonous cloud). Instead of
							gaining an advantageous location, you might learn of a disadvantageous location that you
							could use against your enemies, such as maneuvering them into an awkward corner that hinders
							their melee attacks or a weak spot on the frozen lake that will break if they stand on it.
							You can apply Effort to learn one additional good or bad location within range (one location

					</li>
					<li id="ability-beast-call">
						<p><strong>Beast Call (5 Intellect points):</strong> You summon a horde of small animals or a
							single level 4 beast to help you temporarily. These creatures do your bidding for as long as

					<li id="ability-beast-companion">
						<p><strong>Beast Companion:</strong> A level 2 creature of your size or smaller accompanies you
							and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature,
							and you'll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The beast
							companion acts on your turn. As a level 2 creature, it has a target number of 6 and 6 health
							and it inflicts 2 points of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type (avian,

							beast form, you can't spend Intellect points for any reason other than to try to change to
							your normal form before the one-hour duration is over (a difficulty 2 task). In addition,
							you attack any and every living creature within short range. After you revert to your normal

					<li id="ability-better-living-through-chemistry">
						<p><strong>Better Living Through Chemistry (4 Intellect points):</strong> You've developed drug

					<li id="ability-better-surprise-attack">
						<p><strong>Better Surprise Attack:</strong> If attacking from a hidden vantage, with surprise,

						<p><strong>Biomorphic Detonation (7+ Might points):</strong> You radiate a pulse of biomorphic

							(unless it is Armor provided by a force field effect). If you apply additional Effort to

						<p><strong>Biomorphic Healing (4+ Might points):</strong> You consciously send out a pulse of

						<p><strong>Blend In (4 Intellect points):</strong> When you blend in, creatures still see you,

							reveal your presence or position&mdash;attacking, using an ability, moving a large object,

					<li id="ability-blurring-speed">
						<p><strong>Blurring Speed (7 Speed points):</strong> You move so quickly that until your next

						<p><strong>Bolts of Power (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You blast a fan of lightning out to

							inflicts 4 points of damage. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than to ease
							the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points);
							targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-bouncing-shield">
						<p><strong>Bouncing Shield:</strong> When you use <a href="#ability-throw-force-shield">Throw
								Force Shield</a>, instead of dissipating after one attack (whether it hits or misses),
							it will attack up to two additional targets within short range. Effort or other modifiers
							applied to the first attack affect all other targets as well. Whether you hit all, some, or

							Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-bound-magic-creature">
						<p><strong>Bound Magic Creature:</strong> You have a level 3 magic ally bound to a physical
							object (perhaps a minor djinn bound to a lamp, a lesser demon bound to a coin, or a spirit
							bound to a mirror). The magic ally doesn't yet have the full power that one of its kind
							could possess when mature. Normally, the ally remains quiescent in its bound object. When
							you use an action to manifest it, it appears next to you as a creature that can converse
							with you. The creature has its own personality determined by the GM and is a level higher
							than its base level for one area of knowledge (such as local history). The GM determines
							whether the magic ally has a long-term goal of its own.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each time the magic ally becomes physically manifest, it remains so
							for up to one hour. During that period, it accompanies you and follows your instructions.
							The magic ally must remain an immediate distance from you; if it moves farther away, it is
							yanked back into its object at the end of your following turn and cannot return until after
							your next ten-hour <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>. It doesn't attack creatures,
							but it can use its action to serve as an asset for any one attack you make on your turn.
							Otherwise, it can take actions on its own (though you'll likely roll for it).</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">If the creature is reduced to 0 health, it dissipates. It reforms in
							its object in 1d6 + 2 days.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you lose the bound object, you retain a sense of the direction in
							which it lies. Action to manifest the magic creature.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-brainwashing">
						<p><strong>Brainwashing (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You use trickery, well-spoken lies, and
							mind-affecting chemicals (or other means, like magic or high technology) to make others
							temporarily do what you want them to do. You control the actions of another creature you
							touch. This effect lasts for one minute. The target must be level 3 or lower. You can allow
							it to act freely or override its control on a case-by-case basis as long as you can see it.
							In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase
							the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to control the
							mind of a level 6 target (three levels above the normal limit) or control a target for four
							minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must apply three levels of Effort.
							When the duration ends, the creature doesn't remember being controlled or anything it did
							while under your influence. Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-break-the-line">
						<p><strong>Break the Line (4 Intellect points):</strong> You have an eye for group discipline

							the enemy's line, formation, or swarm attack. This effect lasts for up to a minute or until
							all the affected foes spend a round assessing and resetting themselves to regain their
							normal advantage. Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-break-the-ranks">
						<p><strong>Break the Ranks (6 Speed points):</strong> You move up to a short distance and attack
							up to four different foes as a single action as long as they are all along your path. Any
							modifiers that apply to one attack apply to all the attacks you make. If you have another
							special ability that allows you to move and take an action, when you use Break the Ranks,
							you gain an asset to attacking these foes. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-break-their-mind">
						<p><strong>Break Their Mind (7+ Intellect points):</strong> Using your clever words and
							knowledge of others, and given a couple of rounds of conversation to gain a few specific
							pieces of context regarding your target, you can utter a sentence designed to cause your
							target immediate psychological distress. If the target can hear and understand you, it
							suffers 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and forgets the last day of its life,
							which might mean it forgets you and how it came to be where it currently is. In addition to
							the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to attempt to break the
							mind of one additional target who can hear and understand you. Action to initiate, action to
							complete.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-breaker">
						<p><strong>Breaker:</strong> You are trained in tasks related to damaging objects with the goal
							of breaking, piercing, or demolishing them. It is a Might action to damage an object, and on
							a success, the object moves one step down the object damage track. If the Might roll exceeds
							the difficulty by two steps, the object instead moves two steps down the object damage
							track. If the Might roll exceeds the difficulty by four steps, the object moves three steps
							down the object damage track and is immediately destroyed. Brittle material reduces the
							effective level of the object, while hard material like wood or stone adds 1 to the
							effective level or 2 for very hard objects like those made of metal. Enabler.</p>
					</li>

					<li id="ability-buddy-system">
						<p><strong>Buddy System (3 Intellect points):</strong> Choose one character standing next to
							you. That character becomes your buddy for ten minutes. You are trained in all tasks

							stand next to your buddy, both of you have an asset on Speed defense tasks. You can have
							only one buddy at a time. Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-built-in-weaponry">
						<p><strong>Built-in Weaponry:</strong> Biomechanical implants, a magical jewel fused to your

							cost for you to use this ability. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-burning-light">
						<p><strong>Burning Light (3 Intellect points):</strong> You send a beam of light at a creature

					</li>
					<li id="ability-burst-of-escape">
						<p><strong>Burst of Escape (5 Speed points):</strong> You can take two separate actions this

							Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-bypass-barrier">
						<p><strong>Bypass Barrier (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You get past a door, force field, or
							other barrier up to 3 feet (1 m) thick that is blocking your way. Depending on the barrier,
							this might involve finding a weak spot you can push through, pressing the right button by
							luck, just breaking through, or even weirder explanations like touching a thin place between
							dimensions or an unexpected interaction with your equipment. The difficulty of the task is
							the level of the barrier. This ability allows you alone to pass through, not anyone else,
							and the way through closes at the end of your turn (which might mean you're trapped on the
							far side). You have an asset in any attempts to get through it again. In addition to the
							normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum
							thickness of the barrier, each level adding 3 feet (1 m). Action.</p>

						<p><strong>Call in Favor (4 Intellect points):</strong> A guard, doctor, technician, or hired

					</li>
					<li id="ability-call-through-time">
						<p><strong>Call Through Time (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You call a creature or person of up
							to level 3 from the recent past, and it appears next to you. You can choose a creature that
							you've previously encountered (even if it is now dead), or (no more than once per day) you
							can allow the GM to determine the creature randomly. If you call a random creature, it has a
							10 percent chance of being a creature of up to level 5. The creature has no memory of
							anything before being called by you, though it can speak and has the general knowledge a
							creature of its type should possess. The time-shifted creature does your bidding for as long
							as you concentrate on it, but you must use your action each turn to direct it; otherwise it
							returns to the past.</p>
						<p>In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to call a
							more powerful creature; each level of Effort used in this way increases the creature's level

						<p><strong>Car Surfer:</strong> You can stand or move about on a moving vehicle (such as on the
							hood, on the roof, in the open door well, etc.) with a reasonable expectation of not falling
							off. Unless the vehicle veers sharply, stops suddenly, or otherwise engages in extreme

					<li id="ability-center-of-attention">

					</li>
					<li id="ability-chamber-of-dreams">
						<p><strong>Chamber of Dreams (8 Intellect points):</strong> You and your allies can step into a

						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-charm-machine">
						<p><strong>Charm Machine (2 Intellect points):</strong> You convince an unintelligent machine to
							"like" you. A machine that likes you is 50 percent less likely to function if said function
							would cause you harm. Thus, if a foe attempts to detonate a bomb near you controlled by a
							detonator that likes you, there is a 50 percent chance that it won't explode. Action to
							initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-cloak-of-opportunity">
						<p><strong>Cloak of Opportunity (5 Intellect points):</strong> You set small objects from the

					</li>
					<li id="ability-cloud-personal-memories">
						<p><strong>Cloud Personal Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> If you interact with or study

					</li>
					<li id="ability-coaxing-power">

					<li id="ability-cognizant-offense">
						<p><strong>Cognizant Offense:</strong> During combat, your brain shifts into a sort of battle

					</li>
					<li id="ability-cold-burst">
						<p><strong>Cold Burst (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You emit a burst of cold in all
							directions, up to short range. All within the burst (except you) take 5 points of damage. If
							you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than to ease the task, you deal 2 additional
							points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point

					</li>
					<li id="ability-colossal">
						<p><strong>Colossal:</strong> When you use <a href="#ability-enlarge">Enlarge</a>, you can
							choose to grow up to a base height of 60 feet (18 m). When you do, you add 5 more temporary
							points to your Might Pool (plus any from Gargantuan and Bigger), and you deal an additional
							2 points of damage with melee attacks (plus any from your <a href="#ability-huge">Huge</a>
							ability). For each level of Effort you apply to increase your height further, your total
							height increases by 10 feet (3 m), and you add 1 more point to your Might Pool. Thus, the
							first time you use Enlarge after a ten-hour <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>, if
							you apply two levels of Effort, your base height is 80 feet (24 m), and you add a total of

					<li id="ability-command">
						<p><strong>Command (3 Intellect points):</strong> Through sheer force of will, you can issue a
							simple imperative command to a single living creature, who then attempts to carry out your
							command as its next action. The creature must be within short range and able to understand
							you. The command can't inflict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so "Commit
							suicide" won't work, but "Flee" might. In addition, the command can require the creature to
							take only one action, so "Unlock the door" might work, but "Unlock the door and run through

					<li id="ability-command-machine">
						<p><strong>Command Machine (4 Intellect points):</strong> If you've charmed an unintelligent

					<li id="ability-command-metal">
						<p><strong>Command Metal (5 Intellect points):</strong> You reshape a metallic item as you

							within these limits. You can fuse multiple items together. You can use this power to destroy
							a metal object (as the <a href="#ability-destroy-metal">Destroy Metal</a> ability), or you
							can craft it into another desired shape (crudely, unless you have the proper crafting
							skills). You can then move the new object anywhere within range. For example, you could take
							a few metal shields, fuse them together, and use the resulting shape to block a doorway. You
							can use this ability to make an attack&mdash;causing a foe's armor to constrict, rendering a

						<p><strong>Confuse Enemy (4 Intellect points):</strong> Through a clever bit of misdirection

					<li id="ability-conjuration">
						<p><strong>Conjuration (7 Intellect points):</strong> You produce, as if from thin air, a level

					<li id="ability-connected">
						<p><strong>Connected:</strong> You know people who get things done&mdash;not just respected

					<li id="ability-control-the-savage">
						<p><strong>Control the Savage (6 Intellect points):</strong> You can control a calm nonhuman
							beast within 30 feet (9 m). You control it for as long as you focus all your attention on
							it, using your turn each round. The GM has final say over what counts as a nonhuman beast,

					<li id="ability-control-swarm">
						<p><strong>Control Swarm (2 Intellect points):</strong> Your swarm creatures from your <a

					</li>
					<li id="ability-control-weather">
						<p><strong>Control Weather (10 Intellect points):</strong> You change the weather in your
							general region. If performed indoors, this creates minor effects, such as mist, mild
							temperature changes, and so on. If performed outside, you can create rain, fog, snow, wind,
							or any other kind of normal (not overly severe) weather. The change lasts for a natural
							length of time so that a storm might last for an hour, fog for two or three hours, and snow
							for a few hours (or for ten minutes if it's out of season). For the first ten minutes after
							activating this ability, you can create more dramatic and specific effects, such as
							lightning strikes, giant hailstones, twisters, hurricane-force winds, and so on. These
							effects must occur within 1,000 feet (300 m) of your location. You must spend your turn
							concentrating to create an effect or maintain it in a new round. These effects inflict 6
							points of damage each round. If you have this ability from another source, the cost for the
							ability is 7 Intellect points instead of 10. If you already have the <a

							new ability of the same tier. Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-controlled-change">
						<p><strong>Controlled Change:</strong> You can try to use your <a

					<li id="ability-controlled-fall">
						<p><strong>Controlled Fall:</strong> When you fall while you are able to use actions and within

						<p><strong>Coordinated Effort (3 Intellect points):</strong> When you and the duplicate from

							attacks and treat the attacks as if they were one attack for the purpose of subtracting
							Armor from the damage. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-counter-danger">
						<p><strong>Counter Danger (4 Intellect points):</strong> You negate a source of potential danger

							device held by someone, a creature's natural ability, or a trap triggered by a pressure

							would last for one hour. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-create-deadly-poison">
						<p><strong>Create Deadly Poison (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You create one dose of a level 2
							poison that either inflicts 5 points of damage or hinders the poisoned creature's actions
							for ten minutes (your choice each time you create the poison). You can apply this poison to
							a weapon, food, or drink as part of the action of creating it. In addition to the normal
							options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the poison;
							each level of Effort used in this way increases the poison level by 1. If unused, the poison
							loses its potency after one hour. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-create-water">
						<p><strong>Create Water (2 Intellect points):</strong> You cause water to bubble up from a spot

					</li>
					<li id="ability-creature-insight">
						<p><strong>Creature Insight (3 Intellect points):</strong> When examining any nonhuman creature,
							you can ask the GM one question to gain an idea of its level, its capabilities, what it

							other similar query. This is for difficult or strange creatures beyond those readily
							identified by using skills. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-critter-companion">
						<p><strong>Critter Companion:</strong> A level 1 creature accompanies you and follows your

							normally some sort of domesticated species. You and the GM must work out the details of your
							creature, and you'll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The
							critter companion acts on your turn. As a level 1 creature, it has a target number of 3 and
							3 health, and it inflicts 1 point of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type
							(avian, swimmer, and so on). If your critter companion dies, you can search an urban or wild

					</li>
					<li id="ability-crowd-control">
						<p><strong>Crowd Control (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You control the actions of up to five
							creatures in short range. This effect lasts for one minute. All targets must be level 2 or
							lower. Your control is limited to simple verbal commands like "Stop," "Run away," "Follow
							that guard," "Look over there," or "Get out of my way." All affected creatures respond to
							the command unless you specifically command them otherwise. In addition to the normal
							options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the
							targets or affect an additional five people. Thus, to control a group that has a level 4
							target (two levels above the normal limit) or a group of fifteen people, you must apply two
							levels of Effort. When the Crowd Control ability ends, the creatures remember your commands
							but don't remember being controlled&mdash;your commands seemed reasonable at the time.
							Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-crushing-blow">
						<p><strong>Crushing Blow (2 Might points):</strong> When you use a bashing or bladed weapon in

						<p><strong>Crystalline Body:</strong> You are composed of animate, translucent crystal the color

							However, you're not quick and your Speed defense tasks are hindered. Certain conditions,
							like mundane diseases and poisons, do not affect you. Your crystalline body repairs itself
							more slowly than a body of living flesh would. You have only the one-round, one-hour, and

						<p><strong>Cypher Surge:</strong> When you use a subtle cypher spell, as part of that action you

							Otherwise, the structure can possess different densities, textures, and capacities. This

					<li id="ability-daydream">
						<p><strong>Daydream (4 Intellect points):</strong> You pull someone into a daydream,

							that you have hair or skin clippings from. To all outward appearances, an affected target

					</li>
					<li id="ability-disrupting-touch">
						<p><strong>Disrupting Touch (1+ Might points):</strong> You can turn your Phase Sprint into a
							melee attack by purposefully grazing another creature as you run. When you do, the touch
							releases a violent blast of energy that inflicts 2 points of damage to the target (ignores
							Armor). Whether you hit or miss, your movement (and turn) ends immediately, which puts you
							within immediate distance of your target. If you apply Effort to increase damage rather than
							to ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3
							points); the target takes 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-distance-viewing">
						<p><strong>Distance Viewing (5 Intellect points):</strong> You know that space and distance are
							illusions. You concentrate to create an invisible, immobile sensor at a location you have
							previously visited or viewed (at the GM's discretion, you may have to succeed at an
							Intellect task if the location is warded). The sensor lasts for one hour. Once it is
							created, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell through the sensor. It doesn't grant
							you sensory capabilities beyond the norm. Action to create; action to check.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-distant-interface">
						<p><strong>Distant Interface (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can activate, deactivate, or
							control a machine at long range as if you were next to it, even if normally you would have

							before, the task is hindered by two steps. To use this ability, you must understand the

					</li>
					<li id="ability-distortion">
						<p><strong>Distortion (2 Intellect points):</strong> You modify how a willing creature within

					</li>
					<li id="ability-divide-your-mind">
						<p><strong>Divide Your Mind (7 Intellect points):</strong> You split your consciousness into two

					</li>
					<li id="ability-divine-intervention">
						<p><strong>Divine Intervention (2 Intellect points, or 2 Intellect points + 4 XP):</strong> You
							ask the divine to intervene on your behalf, usually against a creature within long range,
							changing the course of its life in a small way by introducing a major special effect upon
							it. The major special effect is akin to what occurs when you roll a natural 20 on an attack.
							If you want to try for a larger effect, and if the GM allows it, you can attempt a divine
							intervention with a more far-reaching effect, which is more like the kind of <a
								href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> initiated by the GM on their players. In this
							case, Divine Intervention also costs 4 XP, the effect may not work out exactly like you
							hope, and you may not make another plea for divine intervention for a week. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-divine-knowledge">
						<p><strong>Divine Knowledge:</strong> You are trained in all tasks related to knowledge of godly
							beings. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-divine-radiance">
						<p><strong>Divine Radiance (2 Intellect points):</strong> Your prayer calls divine radiance from
							the heavens to punish an unworthy target within long range, inflicting 4 points of damage.
							If the target is a demon, spirit, or something similar, it also stands in unwilling awe of
							the divine energy coursing through it and is unable to act on its next turn. Once exposed to
							this blessing, the target can't be awed by this attack again for several hours. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-divine-symbol">
						<p><strong>Divine Symbol (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You invoke divine power by scribing a
							glowing symbol in the air with your fingers. Writhing pillars of divine radiance spear up to
							five targets within long range. A successful attack on a target inflicts 5 points of damage.
							If you apply Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level
							of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack
							roll. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-do-you-know-who-i-am">
						<p><strong>Do You Know Who I Am? (3 Intellect points):</strong> Acting only as someone who is
							famous and used to privilege can, you verbally harangue a living foe who can hear and
							understand you so forcefully that it is unable to take any action, including making attacks,
							for one round. Whether you succeed or fail, the next action the target takes after your
							attempt is hindered. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-dodge-and-resist">
						<p><strong>Dodge and Resist (3 Speed points):</strong> You can reroll any of your Might, Speed,

					</li>
					<li id="ability-double-strike">
						<p><strong>Double Strike (3 Might points):</strong> When you wield two weapons, you can choose
							to make one attack roll against a foe. If you hit, you inflict damage with both weapons plus
							2 additional points of damage, and because you made a single attack, the target's Armor is
							subtracted only once. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-dragons-maw">
						<p><strong>Dragon's Maw (6 Intellect points):</strong> You fashion and control a "hovering"
							phantasmal construct of magic within long range that resembles a dragon's head. The
							construct lasts for up to an hour, until it is destroyed, or until you cast another spell.
							It is a level 4 construct that inflicts 6 points of damage with its bite when directed.
							While the construct persists, you can use it to manipulate large objects, carry heavy items
							in its mouth, or attack foes. If you use it to attack foes, you must use your action to
							directly control the phantom maw for each attack. Action to initiate.</p>

					</li>
					<li id="ability-drain-charge">
						<p><strong>Drain Charge:</strong> You can drain the power from an artifact or device, allowing
							you to regain 1 Intellect point per level drained. You regain points at the rate of 1 point
							per round and must give your full concentration to the process each round. The GM determines
							whether the device is fully drained (likely true of most handheld or smaller devices) or
							retains some power (likely true of large machines). Action to initiate; action each round to
							drain.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-drain-creature">
						<p><strong>Drain Creature (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You can drain energy from a living

					</li>
					<li id="ability-drain-machine">
						<p><strong>Drain Machine (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You can drain the power from an
							artifact or powered device you touch. If the target is a robot, you inflict 3 points of
							damage and restore 3 points to your Might or Speed Pool. If the target is an object, you
							restore points to your Might or Speed Pool equal to the level of the target. If the target
							is a manifest cypher, it is fully drained and useless. Artifacts and similar devices must
							immediately check for depletion (items with a depletion of "&mdash;" are either immune to
							this ability or have a depletion of 1 in 1d10 when attacked with this ability). Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-drain-power">
						<p><strong>Drain Power (5 Speed points):</strong> You affect the main power source of a robot or
							machine, inflicting upon it all four conditions in <a

							robot to do this (if you are making an attack, it inflicts no damage). Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-draw-conclusion">
						<p><strong>Draw Conclusion (3 Intellect points):</strong> After careful observation and
							investigation (questioning one or more NPCs on a topic, searching an area or a file, and so
							on) lasting a few minutes, you can learn a pertinent fact. This ability is a difficulty 3
							Intellect task. Each additional time you use this ability, the task is hindered by an
							additional step. The difficulty returns to 3 after you rest for ten hours. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-drawing-on-lifes-experiences">
						<p><strong>Drawing on Life's Experiences (6 Intellect points):</strong> You've seen a lot and
							done a lot, and that experience comes in handy. Ask the GM one question, and you'll receive
							a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer,
							the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere
							other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7.
							Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-dreadwood">
						<p><strong>Dreadwood (6 Intellect points):</strong> You manipulate wind, mist, and shadows to
							embody the primordial fear of mysterious woods. For the next minute, you gain an asset on
							intimidation tasks. Creatures within short range may become frightened; make a separate
							Intellect attack roll for each creature (if you are larger than normal from using <a
								href="#ability-great-tree">Great Tree</a> or another source, these rolls are eased).
							Success means that they are frozen in fear, not moving or taking actions for one minute or
							until they are attacked. Some creatures without minds might be immune to this fear. Action.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-dream-becomes-reality">
						<p><strong>Dream Becomes Reality (4 Intellect points):</strong> You create a dream object of any
							shape you can imagine that is your size or smaller, which takes on apparent substance and
							heft. The object is crude and can have no moving parts, so you can make a sword, a shield, a
							short ladder, and so on. The dream object has the approximate mass of the real object, if
							you choose. Your dream objects are as strong as iron, but if you do not remain within long
							range of them, they function for only one minute before fading away. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-dream-thief">
						<p><strong>Dream Thief (2 Intellect points):</strong> You steal a previous dream from a living
							creature within short range. The creature loses 2 points of Intellect (ignores Armor), and
							you learn something the GM chooses to reveal about the creature&mdash;its nature, a portion
							of its plans, a memory, and so on. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-dreamcraft">
						<p><strong>Dreamcraft (1 Intellect point):</strong> You pull an image from a dream into the
							waking world and place it somewhere within long range. The dream lasts for up to one minute,
							and it can be tiny or fill an area an immediate distance in diameter. Though it appears
							solid, the dream is intangible. The dream (a scene, a creature, or an object) is static
							unless you use your action each round to animate it. As part of that animation, you could
							move the dream up to a short distance each round, as long as it remains within long range.
							If you animate the dream, it can make sound but does not produce odor. Direct physical
							interaction or sustained interaction with the dream shatters it into dispersing mist. For
							example, attacking the dream shatters it, as does the strain of keeping up appearances when
							an NPC moves through a dream scene or engages a dream creature in conversation for more than
							a couple of rounds. Action to initiate; action to animate.</p>

					</li>
					<li id="ability-dual-light-wield">
						<p><strong>Dual Light Wield:</strong> You can use two light weapons at the same time, making two
							separate attacks on your turn as a single action. You remain limited by the amount of Effort

							foot (30 cm) per round. You can perceive while passing through a barrier or object, which
							allows you to peek through walls. As a shadow, you can't affect or be affected by normal

							like a grapple line, and so on. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
							choose to use Effort to increase the distance traveled; each level of Effort used in this

						<p><strong>Find the Hidden (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You see the traceries of objects as

							mitigating circumstances. However, you don't know in advance how long it will take. If you

					<li id="ability-fire-bloom">
						<p><strong>Fire Bloom (4+ Intellect points):</strong> Fire blooms within long range, filling an

					<li id="ability-fire-servant">
						<p><strong>Fire Servant (6 Intellect points):</strong> While your <a

							flame that last for up to ten minutes. As an action, you can use the tendrils to attack,
							making a separate attack roll for each. Each tendril inflicts 4 points of damage. Otherwise,
							the attacks function as standard attacks. If you don't use the tendrils to attack, they
							remain but do nothing. Enabler.

					<li id="ability-flamboyant-boast">
						<p><strong>Flamboyant Boast (1 Intellect point):</strong> You boastfully describe an act that
							you will accomplish, and then as part of the same action, you attempt it. If an average
							person would find the action difficult (or impossible) and you succeed on it, creatures who
							witnessed it who are not your allies are potentially dazed on their next turn, and all tasks
							they attempt are hindered. The GM will help you determine whether your boast is something
							that would impress onlookers so significantly. If you attempt the task you boast about but
							fail to accomplish it, all your attempts to affect or attack onlookers who saw you are
							hindered for about ten minutes. Enabler.</p>

					<li id="ability-flash">
						<p><strong>Flash (4 Intellect points):</strong> You create an explosion of energy at a point
							within close range, affecting an area up to immediate range from that point. You must be
							able to see the location where you intend to center the explosion. The blast inflicts 2
							points of damage to all creatures or objects within the area. If you apply Effort to
							increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of

					<li id="ability-flex-skill">
						<p><strong>Flex Skill:</strong> At the beginning of each day, choose one task (other than

					</li>
					<li id="ability-foil-danger">
						<p><strong>Foil Danger (2 Intellect points):</strong> You negate one source of potential danger

							round. This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a trap triggered by a pressure
							plate, or a creature's natural ability (something special, innate, and dangerous, like a
							dragon's fiery breath or a giant cobra's venom). You can also try to foil a foe's mundane
							action (such as an attack with a weapon or claw), so that the action isn't made this round.
							Make your roll against the level of the attack, danger, or creature. Action.</p>

					<li id="ability-font-of-healing">
						<p><strong>Font of Healing:</strong> With your approval, other creatures can touch you and

							fundamental law of gravity around a creature or object (up to twice your mass) within short
							range. The target is caught in your telekinetic grip, and you can move it up to a short
							distance in any direction each round that you retain your hold. A creature in your grip can
							take actions, but it can't move under its own power. Each round after the initial attack,
							you can attempt to keep your grip on the target by spending 2 additional Intellect points
							and succeeding at a difficulty 2 Intellect task. If your concentration lapses, the target
							drops back to the ground. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose
							to use Effort to increase the amount of mass you can affect. Each level allows you to affect
							a creature or object twice as massive as before. For example, applying one level of Effort
							would affect a creature four times as massive as you, two levels would affect a creature
							eight times as massive, three levels would affect a creature sixteen times as massive, and
							so on. Action to initiate.</p>

							minutes. It can be placed anywhere it fits, whether against a solid object (including the
							ground) or floating in the air. Each level of Effort you apply strengthens the barrier by
							one level. For example, applying two levels of Effort creates a level 4 barrier. Action.</p>

							obtain general facts. You also get a good idea of the general layout of the location

					<li id="ability-grab">
						<p><strong>Grab:</strong> While you are using the <a href="#ability-enlarge">Enlarge</a>

					<li id="ability-grandiose-illusion">
						<p><strong>Grandiose Illusion (8 Intellect points):</strong> You create a fantastically complex
							scene of images that fit within a 1-mile (1.5 km) cube that you are also within. You must be
							able to see the images when you create them. The images can move in the cube and act in
							accordance with your desires. They can also act logically (such as reacting appropriately to
							fire or attacks) when you aren't directly observing them. The illusion includes sound and
							smell. For example, armies can clash in battle, with air support from machines or flying
							creatures, on and above terrain of your creation. The illusion lasts for one hour (or

					</li>
					<li id="ability-granite-wall">
						<p><strong>Granite Wall (7+ Intellect points):</strong> You create a level 6 granite wall within
							short range. The wall is 1 foot (30 cm) thick and up to 20 feet by 20 feet (6 m by 6 m) in
							size. It appears resting on a solid foundation and lasts for about ten hours. If you apply
							three levels of Effort, the wall is permanent until destroyed naturally. Action to initiate.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-grasping-foliage">
						<p><strong>Grasping Foliage (3+ Intellect points):</strong> Roots, branches, grass, or other
							natural foliage in the area snags and holds a foe you designate within short range for up to
							one minute. A foe caught in the grasping foliage can't move from its position, and all
							physical tasks, attacks, and defenses are hindered, including attempts to free itself. In
							addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to deal damage
							with the initial attack. Each level applied inflicts 2 additional points of damage when
							Grasping Foliage first snags and holds your foe.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">You can also use this ability to clear an area of entangling growth in

					</li>
					<li id="ability-gravity-cleave">
						<p><strong>Gravity Cleave (3 Intellect points):</strong> You can harm a target within short

					</li>
					<li id="ability-great-tree">
						<p><strong>Great Tree:</strong> When you use <a href="#ability-wooden-body">Wooden Body</a>, you
							may grow to up to 12 feet (4 m) in height. In this larger form, you add 7 points to your

							subtract 7 points from your Might Pool (if this brings the Pool to 0, subtract the overflow
							first from your Speed Pool and then, if necessary, from your Intellect Pool). When you use
							Wooden Body, whether or not you choose to grow, instead of looking like a wooden version of
							your normal self, you can take on the full appearance of a humanoid tree creature or an
							actual tree (including growing additional branches, extra foliage, and so on). This does not
							affect any of your abilities&mdash;in tree shape, you can use type abilities, other focus

					<li id="ability-ice-creation">
						<p><strong>Ice Creation (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You create a solid object of ice that is

							you're not in constant contact with them, they function for only 1d6 + 6 rounds before

					</li>
					<li id="ability-illusory-evasion">
						<p><strong>Illusory Evasion (5 Intellect points):</strong> When you would be hit by an attack,
							you teleport an immediate distance away, leaving behind an illusory copy of yourself to be

							specific suggestion or command; an ideal is an overarching value such as "All life is
							sacred," "My political party is the best," "Children should be seen, not heard," and so on.
							An ideal influences a creature's behavior but doesn't control it. The imparted ideal lasts
							as long as befits the situation, but usually at least a few hours. The ideal is jeopardized

							walking on or the normal orientation of gravity (your choice). If you apply one level of
							Effort, you can also walk on the ceiling or on a liquid or semi-liquid surface such as
							water, mud, quicksand, or even lava (although touching a dangerous surface like lava still
							harms you). If you apply two levels of Effort, you can also walk on air as if it were solid

					</li>
					<li id="ability-impressive-display">
						<p><strong>Impressive Display (2 Might points):</strong> You perform a feat of strength, speed,

							randomly. If you call a random creature, it has a 10 percent chance of being a creature of
							up to level 5. The creature has no memory of anything before being called by you, though it

						<p><strong>Improved Sculpt Light (7+ Intellect points):</strong> You create an object of solid
							light in any shape you can imagine whose base size can fit within a 10-foot (3 m) cube. The
							object appears in an area adjacent to you or floating freely in space up to a long distance
							away, and the object lasts for a few days. The object is crude and can have no moving parts,
							so you can make a wall segment, a block, a box, stairs, and so on. The sculpted object has
							the approximate mass of the real object and is level 6. If you apply Effort to increase the
							size of the object, each level applied increases the size by an additional 10-foot (3 m)

						<p><strong>Meticulous Planner:</strong> If you spend a long time planning an action, you gain an

					<li id="ability-mind-control">
						<p><strong>Mind Control (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You control the actions of another

							Once you have established control, you maintain mental contact with the target and sense
							what it senses. You can allow it to act freely or override its control on a case-by-case
							basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
							increase the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to
							control the mind of a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit) or control a
							target for four minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must apply three

					</li>
					<li id="ability-mind-games">
						<p><strong>Mind Games (3 Intellect points):</strong> You use lies and trickery, mockery, and

					</li>
					<li id="ability-minor-illusion">
						<p><strong>Minor Illusion (1 Intellect point):</strong> You create a single image of a creature

							can move (for example, you could make the illusion of a person walk or attack), but it can't
							leave the area defined by the cube. The illusion includes sound but not smell. It lasts for
							ten minutes, but if you want to change the original illusion significantly&mdash;such as

							<li><em>Light of Truth.</em> Whenever you attempt to discern falsehood during the next hour,

					<li id="ability-misdirect">
						<p><strong>Misdirect (3 Speed points):</strong> When an opponent misses you, you can redirect

						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-misdirect-blame">
						<p><strong>Misdirect Blame (2+ Intellect points):</strong> Using your clever words and knowledge
							of others, you can attempt to alter the narrative so that a target of up to level 3 within
							short range becomes uncertain of its conviction in one simple area, such as their conviction
							that you just stole a fruit from their stand or their belief that they've never met you
							before. This effect usually lasts only for the period of time you spend speaking, and
							perhaps up to a minute longer, before the target realizes its error. In addition to the
							normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the target level
							that can be affected. Afterward, all your tasks to persuade or otherwise socially interact

					</li>
					<li id="ability-mobile-fighter">
						<p><strong>Mobile Fighter (3 Speed points):</strong> As part of your attack, you can leap on or

						<p><strong>Moderate Wish:</strong> At your request, the magic ally from your <a

						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Golden Armor.</em> You gain +3 to Armor for one hour from a translucent sheen of

							<li><em>Golden Fury.</em> A golden light blazes in your eyes. For the next three minutes, if
								you attack a target, you inflict 5 additional points of damage.</li>
							<li><em>Improved Touch of Grace.</em> With the magic ally's touch, you add 6 points to any

								They remain until you spend them, you lose them to damage, or an hour passes.</li>
							<li><em>Invisible.</em> With a touch, the magic ally bends light that falls on you, so you
								seem to disappear. You are invisible to other creatures for ten minutes. While
								invisible, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if
								you do something to reveal your presence or position&mdash;attacking, using an ability,
								moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining

					</li>
					<li id="ability-modify-artifact-power">
						<p><strong>Modify Artifact Power (6 Intellect points):</strong> You permanently add +1 to the
							level of an artifact of up to level 5. The difficulty of this task is equal to the modified

							is not advanced in level. Once modified, the artifact can't be similarly boosted again.
							Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-modify-device">
						<p><strong>Modify Device (4 Intellect points):</strong> You jury-rig a piece of mechanical or

							do so, you must use spare parts equal to an expensive item, have a field science kit (or a
							permanent lab, if you have access to one), and succeed at a difficulty 3 Intellect-based
							task. When complete, using the device eases all tasks performed in conjunction with the
							device, until the device inevitably breaks. For example, you could overclock a computer so
							research tasks using it are easier, modify an espresso maker so that each cup of coffee made
							with it is better, modify a car's engine so that it goes faster (or modify its steering so
							it handles better), and so on. Each use of the modified device requires a depletion roll of

					</li>
					<li id="ability-moon-shape">
						<p><strong>Moon Shape (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You change into a monstrous natural beast,
							such as a wolf, bear, or other terrestrial creature, for up to one hour. If you try to
							change during daylight hours when you are not deep underground (or otherwise away from the
							daylight), you must apply a level of Effort. In your new form, you add 8 points to your
							Might Pool, gain +2 to your Might Edge, add 2 points to your Speed Pool, and gain +2 to your
							Speed Edge. Reverting to your normal form is a difficulty 2 task. While in beast form, you
							are prone to fits of rage (triggered by GM intrusion), during which you attack every living
							creature within short range, and the only way to end the rage is to revert to your normal
							form. Either way, after you revert to your normal form, you take a &minus;1 penalty to all
							rolls for one hour. If you did not kill and eat at least one substantial creature while in
							beast form, the penalty increases to &minus;2 and affects all your rolls for the next day.
							Action to change; action to revert.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-mount">
						<p><strong>Mount:</strong> A level 3 creature serves you as a mount and follows your
							instructions. While you're mounted on it, the creature can move and you can attack on your
							turn, which provides an asset to your attack. You and the GM must work out the details of
							the creature, and you'll probably make rolls for it when it takes noncombat actions. The

							new one. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-move-metal">
						<p><strong>Move Metal (1 Intellect point):</strong> You can exert force on metal objects within
							short range for one round. Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a
							Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable,
							adult human), and you can use it to move metal objects, push against metal objects, and so
							on. For example, in your round, you could lift and pull a light metal object anywhere within
							range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m).
							This power lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in
							most situations, it's not a means of attack. You can't use this ability on your own body.
							The power lasts for one hour or until its Might Pool is depleted, whichever comes first.

						<p><strong>Necromancy (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You animate the body of a dead creature of

						<p><strong>Overwatch (1 Intellect point):</strong> You use a ranged weapon to target a limited

							also negate any benefit the target would have from <a

							unless it can figure out how to control its movement while being phased, which most

						<p><strong>Psychokinetic Attack (5 Intellect points):</strong> You can use this attack in one of

						<p><strong>Push Off and Throw (3 Speed points):</strong> You can make precise, point-to-point

					</li>
					<li id="ability-retrieve-memories">
						<p><strong>Retrieve Memories (3 Intellect points):</strong> You touch the remains of a recently
							killed creature and make an Intellect-based roll to restore its mind to life long enough to
							learn information from it. The GM sets the difficulty based on the amount of time that has
							passed since the creature died. A creature that has been dead for only a few minutes is a
							difficulty 2 task, one that has been dead for an hour is a difficulty 4 task, and one that
							has been dead for a few days is a difficulty 9 task. If you succeed, you awaken the corpse,
							causing its head to animate and perceive things as if it were alive. This enables
							communication for about one minute, which is how long it takes for the creature to realize
							that it's dead. The creature is limited to what it knew in life, though it cannot recall
							minor memories, only big events of importance to it. When the effect ends, or if you fail

					<li id="ability-ribbons-of-dark-matter">
						<p><strong>Ribbons of Dark Matter (2 Intellect points):</strong> For the next minute, dark

					<li id="ability-robot-assistant">
						<p><strong>Robot Assistant:</strong> A level 2 robot of your size or smaller (built by you)
							accompanies you and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work out the details of

							combat usually doesn't make separate attacks but helps with yours. On your action, if the
							artificial assistant is next to you, it serves as an asset for one attack you make on your
							turn. If the robot is destroyed, you can repair the original with a few days' worth of

						<p><strong>Robot Control (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You use your knowledge of robot command

							simple tasks on your behalf while you concentrate. In addition to the normal options for
							using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the mechanized

					</li>
					<li id="ability-robot-evolution">
						<p><strong>Robot Evolution:</strong> Your first artificial assistant from the Robot Assistant

						<p><strong>Salvage and Comfort (2 Intellect points):</strong> You're familiar with open space.
							If you spend an hour using your spacecraft's sensors and make a difficulty 3 Intellect roll,
							you can find salvage in the form of abandoned spacecraft, drifting motes of matter that were
							once inhabited, or a place to hide from pursuit in what most people would otherwise assume
							to be empty space (such as in a nebula, an asteroid field, or the shadow of a moon). Salvage

					<li id="ability-scan">
						<p><strong>Scan (2 Intellect points):</strong> You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m)
							cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short
							range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts
							the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you might
							learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and plastic. You might learn that the
							glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field
							running through it that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the
							creature standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this ability doesn't
							tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don't know what the
							metal and plastic device does. In the second, you don't know if stepping on the floor causes
							the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is not
							very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy fields
							prevent or resist scanning. Action.</p>

					<li id="ability-scramble-machine">

					</li>
					<li id="ability-scratch-existence">
						<p><strong>Scratch Existence (1+ Might points):</strong> You can choose to phase in a way that
							"scratches" normal matter in a long streak as you run using Phase Sprint. This tears a bit
							at you, too, reflected by the Might cost. When you use <a href="#ability-phase-sprint">Phase
								Sprint</a>, you inflict 2 points of damage (ignores Armor) to one target you select as
							you pass within immediate range, without triggering <a
								href="#ability-disrupting-touch">Disrupting Touch</a>. In addition to the normal options
							for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the number of targets along your

							modifies your attack or damage applies to all of these attacks.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Alternatively, if you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than

					<li id="ability-sculpt-flesh">
						<p><strong>Sculpt Flesh (2 Intellect points):</strong> You cause a willing creature's fingers to

							The damage dealt by the target's unarmed strikes increases to 4 points. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-sculpt-light">
						<p><strong>Sculpt Light (4 Intellect points):</strong> You create an object of solid light in
							any shape you can imagine that is your size or smaller, and it persists for about an hour.
							The object appears in an area adjacent to you. It is crude and can have no moving parts, so
							you can make a sword, a shield, a short ladder, and so on. The object has the approximate

					</li>
					<li id="ability-sea-legs">
						<p><strong>Sea Legs:</strong> You have gotten used to rough seas and unexpected surges. You are

					</li>
					<li id="ability-see-history">
						<p><strong>See History (4 Intellect points):</strong> You touch an object, read the subtle
							echoes of its existence through time, ask the GM a question about the object's past, and get
							a general answer. The answers are often in the form of brief images or sensations rather
							than specific answers in a language you know. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the
							more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could

						<p><strong>Soothe the Savage (2 Intellect points):</strong> You calm a nonhuman beast within 30

					</li>
					<li id="ability-speaker-for-the-dead">
						<p><strong>Speaker for the Dead (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You can ask a question of a dead

							understood in life, and it can't provide answers that it wouldn't have known in life. In

					</li>
					<li id="ability-special-shot">
						<p><strong>Special Shot:</strong> When you hit a target with a gun attack, you can choose to

					</li>
					<li id="ability-speedy-recovery">
						<p><strong>Speedy Recovery (3 Intellect points):</strong> Your words enhance the normal

					</li>
					<li id="ability-spin-attack">
						<p><strong>Spin Attack (5+ Speed points):</strong> You stand still and make attacks against up
							to five foes, all as part of the same action in one round. All of the attacks have to be the
							same sort of attack (melee or ranged). Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain
							limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your
							attack or damage applies to all of these attacks. In addition to the normal options for
							using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the number of foes you can attack
							with this ability (one additional foe per level of Effort used in this way). Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-spin-identity">
						<p><strong>Spin Identity (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You convince all intelligent creatures
							who can see, hear, and understand you that you are someone or something other than who you
							actually are. You don't impersonate a specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you
							convince the victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain category of
							people. "We're from the government." "I'm just a simple farmer from the next town over."
							"Your commander sent me." A disguise isn't necessary, but a good disguise will almost
							certainly be an asset to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one
							creature, the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled creatures
							remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other circumstances reveal your true
							identity earlier. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-spirit-accomplice">
						<p><strong>Spirit Accomplice:</strong> A level 3 spirit accompanies you and follows your
							instructions. The spirit must remain within immediate range&mdash;if it moves farther away,
							it fades at the end of your following turn and cannot return for a day. You and the GM must
							work out the details of your spirit accomplice, and you'll probably make rolls for it when
							it takes actions. The spirit accomplice acts on your turn, can move a short distance each
							round, and exists partially out of phase (allowing it to move through walls, though it makes
							a poor porter). The spirit takes up residence in an object you designate, and it manifests
							as either an invisible presence or a ghostly shade. Your spirit accomplice is specialized in
							one knowledge skill the GM determines.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">The spirit is normally insubstantial, but if you use an action and
							spend 3 Intellect points, it accretes enough substance to affect the world around it. As a
							level 3 creature with substance, it has a target number of 9 and a health of 9. It doesn't
							attack creatures, but while substantial, it can use its action to serve as an asset for any
							one attack you make on your turn.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">While corporeal, the spirit can't move through objects or fly. A
							spirit remains corporeal for up to ten minutes at a time, but fades back to being
							insubstantial if not actively engaged. If your spirit accomplice is destroyed, it reforms in
							1d6 days, or you can attract a new spirit in 2d6 days. Enabler.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">An insubstantial creature can't affect or be affected by anything
							unless indicated otherwise, such as when an attack is made with a special weapon. An
							insubstantial creature can pass through solid matter without hindrance, but solid energy
							barriers, such as magical fields of force, keep it at bay.</p>

					</li>
					<li id="ability-spray">
						<p><strong>Spray (2 Speed points):</strong> If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots
							without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow or
							submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of
							hitting. This ability uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has
							less than the number rolled). You are trained in making this attack. If the attack is
							successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal. You can also use this ability on
							multiple thrown weapons (stones, shuriken, daggers, and so on) if you're carrying them on
							your person or they are all within reach. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-spring-away">

					</li>
					<li id="ability-sprint-and-grab">
						<p><strong>Sprint and Grab (2 Speed points):</strong> You can run a short distance and make a

							appropriate). Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-spur-effort">
						<p><strong>Spur Effort (5 Intellect points):</strong> You select an ally within immediate range.

					<li id="ability-stasis">
						<p><strong>Stasis (3 Intellect points):</strong> You surround a foe of your size or smaller with

							target is impervious to harm, cannot be moved, and is immune to all effects. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-stay-the-course">

							not count toward their daily limit. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-stealth-skills">
						<p><strong>Stealth Skills:</strong> You are trained in your choice of two of the following

					</li>
					<li id="ability-still-as-a-statue">
						<p><strong>Still As a Statue (5 Might points):</strong> Drawing upon the power of your Golem
							Body, you freeze in place, burying your essence deep in your stone core. During this time,

							what's happening around you, and no time seems to pass for you. While Still As a Statue, you
							gain +10 to Armor against damage of all sorts. Under normal circumstances, you automatically

					</li>
					<li id="ability-store-energy">
						<p><strong>Store Energy:</strong> When you drain energy with your focus abilities, you can store
							some of it for later in a Siphon Pool. You can spend points from your Siphon Pool as if they
							were from your Might or Speed Pool, or use an action to spend them to restore an equal
							number of points to your Might or Speed Pool. Your Siphon Pool can safely store up to 3
							points; each point beyond that hinders all of your tasks. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-storm-seed">
						<p><strong>Storm Seed (3 Intellect points):</strong> If outside or in a large-enough enclosed
							space, you can seed a natural storm of a kind common to the area. Doing so requires at least
							an hour's concentration as you use your connection to the air (whether this is due to
							nanobots, elemental spirits, magic, or some other source) to initiate proper conditions,
							though it could take longer if the GM feels there are additional obstacles at play. Once the
							storm begins, it lasts for about ten minutes. Once during that period, you can create a more
							dramatic and specific effect appropriate to that kind of storm, such as a lightning strike,
							a squall of giant hailstones, the brief touchdown of a twister, a single gust of
							hurricane-force winds, and so on. These effects must occur within long range of your
							location. You must spend your turn concentrating to create the effect, which occurs a round

							causing it to lose its next turn. If you fail, you still make your normal attack roll, but

					<li id="ability-subtle-tricks">
						<p><strong>Subtle Tricks:</strong> You can use your skills and special abilities in ways that
							don't look like you're doing anything. If the skill or ability would normally require an
							obvious movement, phrase, or other action by you, it instead seems to happen on its own.
							Instead of using your tools to pick a lock, the lock clicks open as you stand near it.
							Instead of manipulating a computer screen, the information you want appears on the screen
							when you look at it. Instead of bluffing your way past some guards, they step aside as you
							approach and let you through. This ability usually only works up to an immediate distance.
							You still must spend points and make rolls to use your skills and abilities with Subtle
							Tricks. Using a skill or ability in a subtle way hinders the task. This ability can't be

					<li id="ability-suggestion">
						<p><strong>Suggestion (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You suggest an action to a creature within

							follows your suggestion. If the suggestion is something that is outside of the target's
							nature or express duty (such as asking a guard to let an intruder pass), the suggestion
							fails. The creature must be level 2 or lower. The effect of your suggestion lasts for up to
							a minute.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
							use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target you can affect by 1. Thus, to affect

					</li>
					<li id="ability-teach-trick">
						<p><strong>Teach Trick (5+ Intellect points):</strong> You spend an hour instructing someone on

							For one hour after you teach them, the student can perform that ability as if it were

					<li id="ability-teamwork">
						<p><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Through example, acts of camaraderie, stories of martial prowess,

							During any round in which you rally your team (by spending 2 Intellect points as part of
							another action), you and your allies inflict 1 additional point of damage in combat. This
							benefit applies only to allies with whom you have spent the last 24 hours. It ends if you

					</li>
					<li id="ability-telekinesis">
						<p><strong>Telekinesis (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can exert force on objects within
							short range. Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of
							1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable adult human),
							and you can use it to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could
							lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like
							a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m). This power lacks the fine control to wield a
							weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it's not a means of attack.
							You can't use this ability on your own body. The power lasts for one hour or until its Might

						push open a barred door.</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="og-csrd-abilities-catalog">
					<li id="ability-telepathic">
						<p><strong>Telepathic (1+ Intellect points):</strong> You can speak telepathically with others
							who are within short range. Communication is two-way, but the other party must be willing
							and able to communicate. You don't have to see the target, but you must know that it's
							within range. You can have more than one active contact at once, but you must establish
							contact with each target individually. Each contact lasts up to ten minutes. If you apply a
							level of Effort to increase the duration rather than ease the task, the contact lasts for 24
							hours. Action to establish contact.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-telepathic-network">
						<p><strong>Telepathic Network (0+ Intellect points):</strong> When you wish it, you can contact
							up to ten creatures known to you, no matter where they are. All targets must be willing and
							able to communicate. You automatically succeed at establishing a telepathic network; no roll
							is required. All creatures in the network are linked and can communicate telepathically with
							one another. They can also "overhear" anything said in the network, if they wish. Activating
							this ability doesn't require an action and doesn't cost Intellect points; to you, it's as
							easy as speaking out loud. The network lasts until you choose to end it. If you spend 5
							Intellect points, you can contact twenty creatures at once, and for every 1 Intellect point
							you spend above that, you can add ten more creatures to the network. These larger networks
							last for ten minutes. Creating a network of twenty or more creatures does require an action

					</li>
					<li id="ability-teleportation">
						<p><strong>Teleportation (6+ Intellect points):</strong> You instantaneously transmit yourself
							to any location that you have seen or been to, no matter the distance, as long as it is on
							Earth (or whatever world you're currently on). In addition to the normal options for using
							Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort
							used in this way affects up to three additional targets. You must touch any additional
							targets. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-telling">
						<p><strong>Telling (2 Intellect points):</strong> This ability provides an asset to any tasks
							for attempting to deceive, persuade, or intimidate. Each use lasts up to a minute; a new use
							(to switch tasks) replaces the previous use. Action to initiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-temporal-acceleration">
						<p><strong>Temporal Acceleration (5 Intellect points):</strong> You or one willing creature you
							touch moves more quickly through time. The effect lasts for one minute. Everything moves
							more slowly for the affected character, while to all others, the character seems to move at
							preternatural speed. The character has an asset on all tasks until the effect ends. After
							the effect ends, the target is exhausted and disoriented by the experience, hindering all
							tasks for one hour. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-temporal-dislocation">
						<p><strong>Temporal Dislocation (7 Intellect points):</strong> You disappear and travel up to
							one hour into the future or the past. While dislocated in time, you perceive events as they
							transpire from your position using your normal senses, but you can't interact with or change
							anything. If you project yourself into the past, you remain there for one hour, at which
							point you've caught up to the present (to anyone with you in the present, you only seem to
							flicker out of existence for a moment). If you project yourself into the future, you remain
							there until the present catches up to you (to anyone with you in the present, you vanish for
							one hour and reappear in the place you left). Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-terrifying-gaze">
						<p><strong>Terrifying Gaze (6 Intellect points):</strong> You project a chilling gaze at all
							living creatures within short range who can see you. Make a separate Intellect attack roll
							for each target. Success means that the creature is frozen in fear, not moving or taking
							actions for one minute or until it is attacked. Some creatures without minds (such as
							robots) might be immune to Terrifying Gaze. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-terrifying-image">
						<p><strong>Terrifying Image (6 Intellect points):</strong> You use a bit of subtle telepathy to
							learn which images would appear terrifying to creatures that you choose within long range.
							Those images appear within that area and menace the appropriate creatures. Make an Intellect
							attack roll against each creature you want to affect. Success means the creature flees in
							terror for one minute, pursued by its nightmares. Failure means the creature ignores the
							images, which do not hamper it in any way. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-terrifying-presence">
						<p><strong>Terrifying Presence (2+ Intellect points):</strong> You convince one intelligent
							target of level 3 or lower that you are its worst nightmare. The target must be within short
							range and be able to understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can't even
							move), the target is paralyzed with fear, runs away, or takes some other action appropriate
							to the circumstances. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
							use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to terrorize a level 5 target
							(two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two levels of Effort. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-theres-your-problem">
						<p><strong>There's Your Problem:</strong> You are trained in tasks related to figuring out how

							speed). Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-thiefs-luck">
						<p><strong>Thief's Luck:</strong> Luck is not the chaotic ocean of random chance most people
							believe it to be. If you fail on a task (including an attack roll or a defense roll), you
							can change the die result to a natural 20. That still might not be enough to succeed if the
							difficulty is higher than 6. Once you use this ability, it is not available again until
							after you make a ten-hour <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>. (Thief's Luck doesn't

					</li>
					<li id="ability-thinking-ahead">
						<p><strong>Thinking Ahead (variable Intellect points):</strong> You produce a remedy that
							removes a negative condition because you've previously spent considerable time thinking
							ahead and preparing for your current situation. For instance, if another character is
							poisoned, you produce an antidote, or if they're blinded, you produce a salve that returns
							sight (assuming they weren't blinded because their eyes were destroyed). The Intellect cost
							for using this ability is equal to the level of effect or creature that caused the negative
							condition. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-third-eye">
						<p><strong>Third Eye (1 Intellect point):</strong> You visualize a place within short range and
							cast your mind to that place, creating an immobile, invisible sensor for one minute or until
							you choose to end this ability. While using your third eye, you see through your sensor
							instead of your eyes using your normal visual abilities. You may perceive the area around

					</li>
					<li id="ability-throw">
						<p><strong>Throw (2 Might points):</strong> When you are using Enlarge and deal damage to a

					</li>
					<li id="ability-throw-enchanted-weapon">
						<p><strong>Throw Enchanted Weapon:</strong> You can throw your enchanted weapon up to short

					</li>
					<li id="ability-throw-force-shield">
						<p><strong>Throw Force Shield:</strong> You can throw your <a

							in your grasp. Enabler.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-thrust">

					</li>
					<li id="ability-thunder-beam">
						<p><strong>Thunder Beam (2 Might points):</strong> You direct a beam of focused sound at a
							target within long range, inflicting 2 points of damage and inducing a resonant destructive
							wave in their body. Each round after this initial attack, you can make another roll for the
							destructive wave to inflict an additional 1 point of damage to the target. If you fail this
							roll, the destructive wave ends. Unlike the initial attack, the destructive wave ignores
							Armor.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Alternatively, you can set up a destructive resonance in a physical

					</li>
					<li id="ability-time-doppelganger">
						<p><strong>Time Doppelganger (6+ Intellect points):</strong> A perfect copy of you appears
							within an immediate distance. This doppelganger is probably a version of you from another
							timeline or the past. The doppelganger is a level 5 NPC with 15 health. It has your mind and
							memories, and you control it as if it were you in another body. In effect, while this
							ability is active, you have two bodies.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">If the doppelganger uses any of your abilities that cost points, those
							points come from your Pools (including spending Effort). Controlling two bodies at once is
							difficult and distracting; while this ability is active, all tasks performed by you or the
							doppelganger are hindered. The doppelganger has no equipment other than simple clothing.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">It remains for up to one minute, but disappears if killed or if you
							use an action to dismiss it. If the doppelganger is killed, you take 5 points of damage that
							ignore Armor, and you lose your next action. If you are killed while the doppelganger is
							present, you live on as the doppelganger (it becomes your character instead of being an NPC
							that disappears). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use
							Effort to increase the duration of this ability; each level of Effort used in this way adds
							one minute to the doppelganger's existence.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you also have this ability from another source, you may use either
							ability, the doppelganger is 1 level higher, and it has 3 additional health. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-time-loop">
						<p><strong>Time Loop (4 Intellect points):</strong> You call yourself from a few moments in the
							future to help you in the present. On the round you use this ability, your future self
							appears anywhere you choose within immediate range and takes an action. On the second round,
							you and your future self both take actions, and your future self's action is eased. On the
							third round, you and your future self both disappear. On the fourth round, you catch up to
							your future self, reappear wherever your future self initially appeared in the first round,
							and can take your actions normally.</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">Your future self shares your stats, so any damage that either of you
							takes applies to the same stat Pools. If your future self is killed, you and your future
							self disappear in the third round (as normal) and you reappear, dead, in the fourth round.
							Neither you nor your future self can use Time Loop again until you reappear as your future
							self in the fourth round. Action.</p>
						<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
							<p>In effect, Time Loop lets "you" take an action on the round you use it, two actions on

					<li id="ability-time-travel">
						<p><strong>Time Travel (10+ Intellect points):</strong> You and up to three willing characters

							Effort applied, you can travel ten more years or bring three more creatures with you. When
							you appear in the new moment in time, you do so in the same position you were in when you
							used this ability. Upon arriving at your temporal destination, you and the other time
							travelers are stunned for one minute. In order to return to your original time, you must use
							this ability again. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-tinker">
						<p><strong>Tinker (1 Intellect point):</strong> You make a device do something different from

					<li id="ability-transcend-the-script">
						<p><strong>Transcend the Script (5 Intellect points):</strong> Whether they are lines you wrote,

					<li id="ability-trapfinder">
						<p><strong>Trapfinder (3+ Intellect points):</strong> You find any traps (like a floor that

					<li id="ability-trapster">
						<p><strong>Trapster:</strong> You are trained in creating simple traps for human-sized or

							from the surrounding environment. When you lay a trap, decide whether you want to hold the
							victim in place (a snare) or inflict damage (a deadfall). Creating a snare is a difficulty 3
							task, while the difficulty of creating a deadfall is equal to the number of points of damage
							you want it to inflict. For example, if you want to inflict 4 points of damage, that's a
							difficulty 4 task (the training that comes with this ability eases the task).</p>
						<p class="og-csrd-indent">On a success, you create your one-use trap in about one minute, and it

							stands). Unless the tree is killed by damage, you can animate it again when the ability
							duration expires, but any damage it has carries over to its newly animated state. In
							addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect more
							trees; each level of Effort used affects one additional tree. Action.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="ability-tree-travel">
						<p><strong>Tree Travel (4+ Intellect points):</strong> You enter one tree and instantaneously
							and safely emerge from another one within long distance. You don't need to specify which
							tree you're exiting from (if you know there are trees in that direction, you can decide how
							far to go and you will step out of a tree in that area). If the starting tree's trunk isn't
							as large as your body, you must apply a level of Effort to enter it. You can choose to use
							Effort to increase the distance you travel; one level of Effort used in this way increases
							the range to very long, two levels raise it to one mile (1.5 km), and each additional level
							of Effort beyond that increases it by an additional mile. Action.</p>

				<h4 id="equipment-currency-and-prices">Currency and Prices<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#equipment-currency-and-prices" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Dollars, pounds, euros, credits, gold pieces, Martian solval beads, Corso moons and stars, bottle
					caps&mdash;a lot of different currencies might be used in your game, depending on the setting and
					the genre. You should use whatever you like. In the Cypher System rules, we talk in generalities
					rather than specifics. Not unlike saying immediate or short distance rather than giving precise
					numbers, we talk about goods and services in terms of inexpensive, moderately priced, expensive,
					very expensive, or exorbitant.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The GM can figure out what those things mean in their setting. In a fantasy
					setting, an inexpensive item might be 1 or 2 copper pennies, while an expensive item might require
					gold on the table. The exact amount can vary, and in many campaigns, the exact amount will matter.
					The GM will develop a detailed price list for their setting, and players will track their money on
					their character sheets to determine what they can afford, often ignoring the terms inexpensive,
					moderately priced, and so on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">But some GMs might want to keep things simple and use only the general terms,
					indicating currency just as flavor now and then. In a space opera game, where the PCs are the crew
					of a starship blazing about the galaxy in search of adventure and profit, fuel and upkeep for the
					ship might be expensive. Hauling a few passengers from Epsilon Eridani back to Earth might earn
					enough to purchase six expensive items but cost the equivalent of two expensive items, leaving the
					crew with the means to refuel and maintain the ship for two further voyages. In such a game, where
					money only means keeping the ship flying, no one has to talk in specific amounts. Characters might
					refer to "galactic credits" or something similar, but amounts might not be tracked on the character
					sheets.</p>
				<h5 id="equipment-price-categories">Price Categories<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#equipment-price-categories" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>There are five price categories for goods and services.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<p><strong>An inexpensive item</strong> is something that common people buy. A simple meal or a
							drink in the bar. A pen and some paper. A book or magazine.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>A moderately priced item</strong> is something that common people buy, but not too
							often and not in great quantities. A small piece of furniture. A major entertainment. An
							expensive meal. A new outfit.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>An expensive item</strong> is something that would strain a common person's finances.
							Rent on a simple apartment. A major piece of furniture. A very nice outfit. The cost to
							travel a long distance (if appropriate to the setting).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>A very expensive item</strong> is probably out of the reach of most people except in
							very special circumstances. Jewelry. Luxury furnishings.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>An exorbitant item</strong> is something only the very rich can afford. A very nice
							house. A ship. Extremely expensive jewelry or art.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>A priceless item</strong> is something that even the very rich can't afford,
							requiring the resources of a nation-state, or similar entity appropriate to the setting, to
							acquire or build.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Think of the categories as powers of 10. That is to say, a moderately priced item is ten times more
					costly than an inexpensive item. An expensive item is ten times more costly than a moderately priced
					item, and thus 100 times the cost of something inexpensive. A very expensive item is ten times the
					cost of an expensive one, 100 times the cost of a moderate one, and 1,000 times the cost of an
					inexpensive one. An exorbitant item is priced ten times beyond that.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>In some settings, even the generalization offered by the pricing categories might be too specific
						or cumbersome. In many superhero games, for example, prices are relatively moot. After saving
						the city, typical superheroes don't worry about paying rent or how much dinner will cost. On the
						other hand, in a grittier superhero game, maybe that's exactly what they worry about.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="equipment-using-the-price-categories">Using the Price Categories<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#equipment-using-the-price-categories" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Regardless of how precise you want to be with prices and currency, you can use the price categories
					in a variety of ways.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It's easy for a GM to say to a player "You can afford two extra moderately
					priced things at the start of the game." The player can look on the list and pick two moderately
					priced items without worrying about their cost. Plus, this approach makes it clear that they get two
					items, not twenty inexpensive items or one more expensive item that perhaps would not be appropriate
					for a starting character. The categories make it easy to lump similar items together.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The GM can also say "You can have whatever inexpensive items you want, and
					don't worry about the cost." At higher tiers, when the PCs have more wealth, <a
						href="#followers">followers</a>, and so on, the GM can do this with moderate or even expensive
					items. This allows the group to skip over playing through a shopping trip to get supplies, and
					players don't have to track prices down to the last coin.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Finally, the categories can be shorthand when evaluating loot, dividing up the
					spoils among the PCs, and resolving other story-based occurrences that crop up in the game without
					dealing in the minutiae of exact prices. This is of particular use in high-powered games where the
					PCs are rich and powerful.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Level of Equipment:</strong> Mundane equipment is about level 4&mdash;less if of inferior
						quality or materials, more if of superior quality or materials. This means that in a setting
						based on the distant past, the default level might be 3, while in the future it might be 5 or 6.
						So an average serf 's tool in the Dark Ages is level 3, easily broken, while an average tool on
						a space station is level 6, made of advanced polymers.</p>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="equipment-armor">Armor<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#equipment-armor" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Characters expecting danger frequently wear armor. Even the simplest protective covering helps
					against stabs and cuts, and more sophisticated or heavier armor protects against graver threats.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You can wear only one type of armor at a time&mdash;you cannot wear chainmail
					hauberk and scale armor together, for example. However, Armor bonuses from multiple sources combine
					to provide a total Armor rating. For example, if you have subdermal implants that give you +1 to
					Armor, a force field that offers another +1 to Armor, and beastskin that grants +2 to Armor, you
					have a total of +4 to Armor.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In general, light armor is a moderately priced item, medium armor is
					expensive, and heavy armor is very expensive. <a href="#part-3-genres">Part 3: Genres</a> offers
					more specific details on the kinds of armor available in a given setting. Keep in mind that in many

				<h5 id="equipment-explosive-weapons">Explosive Weapons<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#equipment-explosive-weapons" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Bombs, grenades, missiles, and other explosives operate differently than other weapons. They affect
					all targets within an area (usually an immediate area) and inflict damage to all of them. A separate
					attack roll is required for each (or a Speed defense roll if the PCs are the targets of such an
					attack), although to simplify, the player can make one attack roll and compare it to the difficulty
					to attack each target. Usually, even if the attack roll fails (or the Speed defense roll succeeds),
					the targets still suffer a smaller amount of damage, often 1 point.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Explosives like grenades can be thrown a short distance. Otherwise, another
					launcher weapon is needed to project them a long distance (or farther).</p>

				<p>Although the types of items for sale vary greatly based on the setting, a few things are always
					present, like food, lodging, and clothing. However, these goods and services can span the price
					categories. For example, you can get an inexpensive meal, a moderately priced meal, an expensive
					meal, and so on. An inexpensive meal is light and probably not very nutritious. An expensive meal is
					available only in nice restaurants in certain locations. An exorbitant meal is probably a feast for
					a crowd, with the finest foods and drink available.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Nightly lodging is similar, although the bottom end starts out worse. An
					inexpensive night's lodging is probably a flea-ridden mat on the floor of a room filled with other
					lodgers. Typical lodging (a private room with a decent bed) is probably in the moderately priced
					range. Very expensive lodging might be a suite of rooms with delicious meals and personal services
					(such as massages and grooming) included.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Inexpensive clothing is just a step up from rags, but moderately priced
					clothing is decent enough. For a formal party, you'd want expensive clothing. The very rich likely
					wear very expensive clothing most of the time, and exorbitant clothing (and jewelry) when they go to
					their elite galas.</p>

				<p>Cyphers can sometimes be physical items like equipment, but they work very differently. To be
					entirely accurate, cyphers might have the veneer of equipment, but don't fall into the trap of
					confusing the two. Cyphers are far more akin to PC special abilities than to gear. In a fantasy
					game, they might be potions, scrolls, or charms. In a science fiction game, cyphers might be
					interesting throwaway devices or alien crystals of unknown providence. In other games, they might
					just represent good fortune or sudden inspiration. See <a href="#chapter-24-cyphers">Chapter 24:
						Cyphers</a> for more details.</p>

				<p>Artifacts are more powerful than equipment and can't simply be purchased. <a
						href="#part-3-genres">Part 3: Genres</a> offers a few sample artifacts appropriate for various
					settings.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each artifact has a level and a rate of power depletion. When an artifact is
					used or activated, the player rolls the designated die (1d6, 1d10, 1d20, or 1d100). If the die shows
					the depletion number(s), the item works, but that is its last use. A depletion entry of "&mdash;"
					means that the artifact never depletes, and an entry of "automatic" means that it can be used only
					once.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Depowered artifacts can sometimes be recharged using the repair rules,
					depending on the item's nature. Other special abilities can also repower an expended item, but
					probably for only one use.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For GM information on artifacts, see <a
						href="#chapter-25-running-the-cypher-system">Chapter 25: Running the Cypher System</a>.</p>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#equipment-finding-identifying-and-using-artifacts"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Characters can sometimes find artifacts while on adventures. They might be in ancient ruins, either
					intact or in need of manipulation to get them working. They could have been stolen from well-guarded
					military installations. They might be granted as rewards or taken from fallen foes. Sometimes they
					can even be purchased from a specialized source, but this occurs more rarely than most PCs would
					probably like.</p>
				<p>After the characters find an artifact, identifying it is a separate Intellect task. The GM sets the
					difficulty of the task, but it is usually equal to the artifact's level. Identifying it takes
					fifteen minutes to three hours. If the PCs can't identify an artifact, they can bring it to an
					expert to be identified or, if desired, traded or sold.</p>
				<p>Characters can attempt to use an artifact that has not been identified, which is usually an Intellect
					task equal to the artifact's level + 2. Failure might mean that the PCs can't figure out how to use
					the artifact or they use it incorrectly (GM's discretion). Of course, even if characters use an
					unidentified artifact correctly the first time, they have no idea what the effect might be.</p>
				<p>Once characters identify an artifact, using it for the first time requires an additional Intellect
					action; this process is far more complex than pushing a button. It can involve manipulating
					touchscreens, reciting the proper arcane words, or anything else that fits the setting. The GM sets
					the difficulty, but it is usually equal to the artifact's level.</p>

					<dl>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Action</dt>
						<dd>Anything a character does that is significant&mdash;punch a foe, leap a chasm, activate a
							device, use a special power, and so on. Each character can take one action in a round.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Character</dt>
						<dd>Any creature in the game capable of acting, whether it is a player character (PC) run by a
							player or a nonplayer character (NPC) run by the game master (GM). In the Cypher System,
							even bizarre creatures, sentient machines, and living energy beings can be "characters."
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Difficulty</dt>
						<dd>A measure of how easy it is to accomplish a task. Difficulty is rated on a scale from 1
							(lowest) to 10 (highest). Altering the difficulty to make a task harder is called
							"hindering." Altering it to make a task easier is called "easing." All changes in difficulty
							are measured in steps. Difficulty often equates directly with level, so opening a level 3
							locked door probably has a difficulty of 3.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Ease</dt>
						<dd>A decrease in a task's difficulty, usually by one step. If something doesn't say how many
							steps it eases a task, then it reduces the difficulty by one step.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Effort</dt>
						<dd>Spending points from a stat Pool to reduce the difficulty of a task. A PC decides whether or
							not to apply Effort on their turn before the roll is made. NPCs never apply Effort.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Hinder</dt>
						<dd>An increase in a task's difficulty, usually by one step. If something doesn't say how many
							steps it hinders a task, then it increases the difficulty by one step.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Inability</dt>
						<dd>The opposite of trained&mdash;you're hindered whenever you attempt a task that you have an
							inability in. If you also become trained in the task, the training and the inability cancel
							each other out and you become practiced.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Level</dt>
						<dd>A way to measure the strength, difficulty, power, or challenge of something in the game.
							Everything in the game has a level. NPCs and objects have levels that determine the
							difficulty of any task related to them. For example, an opponent's level determines how hard
							they are to hit or avoid in combat. A door's level indicates how hard it is to break down. A
							lock's level determines how hard it is to pick. Levels are rated on a scale from 1 (lowest)
							to 10 (highest). PC tiers are a little like levels, but they go only from 1 to 6 and
							mechanically work very differently than levels&mdash;for example, a PC's tier does not
							determine a task's difficulty.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Practiced</dt>
						<dd>The normal, unmodified ability to use a <a href="#skills">skill</a>&mdash;not trained,
							specialized, or an inability. Your type determines what weapon skills you're practiced in;
							if you aren't practiced with a type of weapon, you have an inability in it.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Roll</dt>
						<dd>A d20 roll made by a PC to determine whether an action is successful. Although the game
							occasionally uses other dice, when the text simply refers to "a roll," it always means a d20
							roll.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Round</dt>
						<dd>A length of time about five to ten seconds long. There are about ten rounds in a minute.
							When it's really important to track precise time, use rounds. Basically, it's the length of
							time to take an action in the game, but since everyone more or less acts simultaneously, all
							characters get to take an action each round.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Specialized</dt>
						<dd>Having an exceptional amount of <a href="#skills">skill</a> in a task. Being specialized
							eases the task by two steps. So, if you are specialized in climbing, all your climbing tasks
							are eased by two steps.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Stat</dt>
						<dd>One of the three defining characteristics for PCs: <a href="#might">Might</a>, <a
								href="#speed">Speed</a>, or <a href="#intellect">Intellect</a>. Each stat has two
							values: Pool and Edge. Your Pool represents your raw, innate ability, and your Edge
							represents knowing how to use what you have. Each stat Pool can increase or decrease over
							the course of play&mdash;for example, you can lose points from your Might Pool when struck
							by an opponent, spend points from your Intellect Pool to activate a special ability, or rest
							to recover points in your Speed Pool after a long day of marching. Anything that damages a
							stat, restores a stat, or boosts or penalizes a stat affects the stat's Pool.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Task</dt>
						<dd>Any action that a PC attempts. The GM determines the difficulty of the task. In general, a
							task is something that you do and an action is you performing that task, but in most cases
							they mean the same thing.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Trained</dt>
						<dd>Having a reasonable amount of <a href="#skills">skill</a> in a task. Being trained eases the
							task. For example, if you are trained in climbing, all climbing tasks for you are eased. If
							you become very skilled at that task, you become specialized instead of trained. You do not
							need to be trained to attempt a task.</dd>
						<dt class="text-uppercase">Turn</dt>
						<dd>The part of the round when a character or creature takes its actions. For example, if a
							Warrior and an Adept are fighting an orc, each round the Warrior takes an action on their
							turn, the Adept takes an action on their turn, and the orc takes an action on its turn. Some
							abilities or effects last only one turn, or end when the next turn is started.</dd>

				<h4 id="rules-taking-action">Taking Action <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-taking-action"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Each character gets one turn each round. On a character's turn, they can do one thing&mdash;an
					action. All actions fall into one of three categories: Might, Speed, or Intellect (just like the
					three stats). Many actions require die rolls&mdash;rolling a d20.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Every action performs a task, and every task has a difficulty that determines
					what number a character must reach or surpass with a die roll to succeed.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Most tasks have a difficulty of 0, which means the character succeeds
					automatically. For example, walking across a room, opening a door, and throwing a stone into a
					nearby bucket are all actions, but none of them requires a roll. Actions that are usually difficult
					or that become difficult due to the situation (such as shooting at a target in a blizzard) have a
					higher difficulty. These actions usually require a roll.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some actions require a minimum expenditure of Might, Speed, or Intellect
					points. If a character cannot spend the minimum number of points needed to complete the action, they
					automatically fail at the task.</p>
				<h5 id="rules-determining-task-stat">Determining Task Stat <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#rules-determining-task-stat" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Every task relates to one of a character's three stats: <a href="#might">Might</a>, <a
						href="#speed">Speed</a>, or <a href="#intellect">Intellect</a>. Physical activities that require
					strength, power, or endurance relate to Might. Physical activities that require agility,
					flexibility, or fast reflexes relate to Speed. Mental activities that require force of will, memory,
					or mental power relate to Intellect. This means you can generalize tasks into three categories:
					Might tasks, Speed tasks, and Intellect tasks. You can also generalize rolls into three categories:
					Might rolls, Speed rolls, and Intellect rolls.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The category of the task or roll determines what kind of Effort you can apply
					to the roll and may determine how a character's other abilities affect the roll. For example, an
					Adept may have an ability that makes them better at Intellect rolls, and a Warrior may have an
					ability that makes them better at Speed rolls.</p>

				<p>The most frequent thing a GM does during the game&mdash;and probably the most important
					thing&mdash;is set a task's difficulty. To make the job easier, use the Task Difficulty table, which
					associates a difficulty rating with a descriptive name, a target number, and general guidance about
					the difficulty.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Every difficulty from 1 to 10 has a target number associated with it. The
					target number is easy to remember: it's always three times the difficulty. The target number is the
					minimum number a player needs to roll on a d20 to succeed at the task. Moving up or down on the
					table is called hindering or easing, which is measured in steps.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, reducing a difficulty 5 task to a difficulty 4 task is "easing
					the difficulty by one step" or just "easing the difficulty" or "easing the task." Most modifiers
					affect the difficulty rather than the player's roll. This has two consequences:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Low target numbers such as 3 or 6, which would be boring in most games that use a d20, are not
						boring in the Cypher System. For example, if you need to roll a 6 or higher, you still have a
						25% chance to fail.</li>
					<li>The upper levels of difficulty (7, 8, 9, and 10) are all but impossible because the target
						numbers are 21 or higher, which you can't roll on a d20. However, it's common for PCs to have
						abilities or equipment that ease a task and thus lower the target number to something they can
						roll on a d20.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character's tier does not determine a task's level. Things don't get more
					difficult just because a character's tier increases&mdash;the world doesn't instantly become a more
					difficult place. Fourth-tier characters don't deal only with level 4 creatures or difficulty 4 tasks
					(although a fourth-tier character probably has a better shot at success than a first-tier character
					does). Just because something is level 4 doesn't necessarily mean it's meant only for fourth-tier
					characters. Similarly, depending on the situation, a fifth-tier character could find a difficulty 2
					task just as challenging as a second-tier character does.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Therefore, when setting the difficulty of a task, the GM should rate the task
					on its own merits, not on the power of the characters.</p>
				<h5 id="modifying-the-difficulty">Modifying the Difficulty <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#modifying-the-difficulty" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>After the GM sets the difficulty for a task, the player can try to modify it for their character. Any
					such modification applies only to this particular attempt at the task. In other words, rewiring an
					electronic door lock normally might be difficulty 6, but since the character doing the work is
					skilled in such tasks, has the right tools, and has another character assisting them, the difficulty
					in this instance might be much lower. That's why it's important for the GM to set a task's
					difficulty without taking the character into account. The character comes in at this step.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">By using skills and assets, working together, and&mdash;perhaps most
					important&mdash;applying Effort, a character can ease a task by multiple steps to make it easier.
					Rather than adding bonuses to the player's roll, reducing the difficulty lowers the target number.
					If they can reduce the difficulty of a task to 0, no roll is needed; success is automatic.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>An exception is if the GM decides to use a <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> on the task,

				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">There are three basic ways in which a character can ease a task: skills,

				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">

						href="#modifying-the-difficulty-skills" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Characters may be skilled at performing a specific task. A skill can vary from character to
					character. For example, one character might be skilled at lying, another might be skilled at
					trickery, and a third might be skilled in all interpersonal interactions. The first level of being
					skilled is called being trained, and it eases that task by one step. More rarely, a character can be
					incredibly skilled at performing a task. This is called being specialized, and it eases the task by
					two steps instead of one. Skills can never decrease a task by more than two steps&mdash;any more
					than two steps from being trained and specialized don't count.</p>

				<h6 id="modifying-the-difficulty-assets">Assets <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#modifying-the-difficulty-assets" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>An asset is anything that helps a character with a task, such as having a really good crowbar when
					trying to force open a door or being in a rainstorm when trying to put out a fire. Appropriate
					assets vary from task to task. The perfect awl might help when woodworking, but it won't make a
					dance performance much better. An asset usually eases a task by one step. Assets can never ease a
					task by more than two steps&mdash;any more than two steps from assets don't count.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>The important thing to remember is that a skill can reduce the difficulty by no more than two
						steps, and assets can reduce the difficulty by no more than two steps, regardless of the
						situation. Thus, no task's difficulty will ever be reduced by more than four steps without using
						Effort.</p>
				</div>
				<h6 id="modifying-the-difficulty-effort">Effort <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#modifying-the-difficulty-effort" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>A player can apply Effort to ease a task. To do this, the player spends points from the stat Pool
					that's most appropriate to the task. For example, applying Effort to push a heavy rock off a cliff
					requires a player to spend points from the character's Might Pool; applying Effort to activate an
					unusual machine interface requires them to spend points from the character's Intellect Pool. For
					every level of Effort spent on a task, the task is eased. It costs 3 points from a stat Pool to
					apply one level of Effort, and it costs 2 additional points for every level thereafter (so it costs
					5 points for two levels of Effort, 7 points for three levels of Effort, and so on). A character must
					spend points from the same stat Pool as the type of task or roll&mdash;Might points for a Might
					roll, Speed points for a Speed roll, or Intellect points for an Intellect roll.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Every character has a maximum level of Effort they can apply to a single task.
					Effort can never ease a task by more than six steps&mdash;any more than six steps from applying
					Effort doesn't count.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Free Level of Effort:</strong> A few abilities give you a free level of Effort (these

							exceed the Effort limit for your character, but not the six-step limit for easing a task.

				<hr>
				<h4 id="rules-rolling-the-die">Rolling the Die <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#rules-rolling-the-die" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>To determine success or failure, a player rolls a die (always a d20). If they roll the target number
					or higher, they succeed. Most of the time, that's the end of it&mdash;nothing else needs to be done.
					Rarely, a character might apply a small modifier to the roll. If they have a +2 bonus when
					attempting specific actions, they add 2 to the number rolled. However, the original roll matters if
					it's a special roll.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If a character applies a modifier to the die roll, it's possible to get a
					result of 21 or higher, in which case they can attempt a task with a target number above 20. But if
					there is no possibility for success&mdash;if not even rolling a natural 20 (meaning the d20 shows
					that number) is sufficient to accomplish the task&mdash;then no roll is made. Otherwise, characters
					would have a chance to succeed at everything, even impossible or ridiculous tasks such as climbing
					moonbeams, throwing elephants, or hitting a target on the opposite side of a mountain with an arrow.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If a character's modifiers add up to +3, treat them as an asset instead. In
					other words, instead of adding a +3 bonus to the roll, reduce the difficulty by one step. For
					example, if a Warrior has a +1 bonus to attack rolls from a minor effect, a +1 bonus to attack rolls
					from a special weapon quality, and a +1 bonus to attack rolls from a special ability, they do not
					add 3 to their attack roll&mdash;instead, they reduce the difficulty of the attack by one step. So
					if they attack a level 3 foe, they would normally roll against difficulty 3 and try to reach a
					target number of 9, but thanks to their asset, they roll against difficulty 2 and try to reach a
					target number of 6.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This distinction is important when stacking skills and assets to decrease the
					difficulty of an action, especially since reducing the difficulty to 0 or lower means no roll is
					needed.</p>
				<h5 id="rules-the-player-always-rolls">The Player Always Rolls <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#rules-the-player-always-rolls" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>In the Cypher System, players always drive the action. That means they make all the die rolls. If a
					PC leaps out of a moving vehicle, the player rolls to see if they succeed. If a PC searches for a
					hidden panel, the player rolls to determine whether they find it. If a rockslide falls on a PC, the
					player rolls to try to get out of the way. If a PC and an NPC arm wrestle, the player rolls, and the
					NPC's level determines the target number. If a PC attacks a foe, the player rolls to see if they
					hit. If a foe attacks the PC, the player rolls to see if they dodge the blow.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As shown by the last two examples, the PC rolls whether they are attacking or
					defending. Thus, something that improves defenses might ease or hinder their rolls. For example, if
					a PC uses a low wall to gain cover from attacks, the wall eases the player's defense rolls. If a foe
					uses the wall to gain cover from the PC's attacks, it hinders the player's attack rolls.</p>
				<h5 id="rules-special-rolls">Special Rolls <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-special-rolls"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>If a character rolls a natural 1, 17, 18, 19, or 20 (meaning the d20 shows that number), special
					rules come into play. These are explained in more detail in the following sections.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li><strong>1: GM Intrusion.</strong> The GM makes a free intrusion (see below) and doesn't award
						experience points (XP) for it.</li>
					<li><strong>17: Damage Bonus.</strong> If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 1
						additional point of damage.</li>
					<li><strong>18: Damage Bonus.</strong> If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 2
						additional points of damage.</li>
					<li><strong>19: Minor Effect.</strong> If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 3
						additional points of damage or the PC gets a minor effect in addition to the normal results of
						the task. If the roll was something other than an attack, the PC gets a minor effect in addition
						to the normal results of the task.</li>
					<li><strong>20: Major Effect.</strong> If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 4
						additional points of damage or the PC gets a major or minor effect in addition to the normal
						results of the task. If the roll was something other than an attack, the PC gets a major effect
						in addition to the normal results of the task. If the PC spent points from a stat Pool on the
						action, the point cost for the action decreases to 0, meaning the character regains those points
						as if they had not spent them at all.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="special-rolls-gm-intrusion">GM Intrusion <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#special-rolls-gm-intrusion" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p><a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> is explained in more detail in <a
						href="#chapter-25-running-the-cypher-system">Chapter 25: Running the Cypher System</a>, but
					essentially it means that something occurs to complicate the character's life. The character hasn't
					necessarily fumbled or done anything wrong (although perhaps they did). It could just be that the
					task presents an unexpected difficulty or something unrelated affects the current situation.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For GM intrusion on a defense roll, a roll of 1 might mean that the PC takes 2
					additional points of damage from the attack, indicating that the opponent got in a lucky blow.</p>
				<h5 id="special-rolls-minor-effect">Minor Effect <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#special-rolls-minor-effect" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>A minor effect happens when a player rolls a natural 19. Most of the time, a minor effect is slightly
					beneficial to the PC, but not overwhelming.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A climber gets up the steep slope a bit faster. A repaired machine works a bit
					better. A character jumping down into a pit lands on their feet. Either the GM or the player can
					come up with a possible minor effect that fits the situation, but both must agree on what it should
					be.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Don't waste a lot of time thinking of a minor effect if nothing appropriate
					suggests itself. Sometimes, in cases where only success or failure matters, it's okay to have no
					minor effect. Keep the game moving at an exciting pace.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In combat, the easiest and most straightforward minor effect is dealing 3
					additional points of damage with an attack. The following are other common minor effects for combat:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li><strong>Damage object:</strong> Instead of striking the foe, the attack strikes what the foe is
						holding. If the attack hits, the character makes a Might roll with a difficulty equal to the
						object's level. On a success, the object moves one or more steps down the object damage track.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Distract:</strong> For one round, all of the foe's tasks are hindered.</li>
					<li><strong>Knock back:</strong> The foe is knocked or forced back a few feet. Most of the time,
						this doesn't matter much, but if the fight takes place on a ledge or next to a pit of lava, the
						effect can be significant.</li>
					<li><strong>Move past:</strong> The character can move a short distance at the end of the attack.
						This effect is useful to get past a foe guarding a door, for example.</li>
					<li><strong>Strike a specific body part:</strong> The attacker strikes a specific spot on the
						defender's body. The GM rules what special effect, if any, results. For example, hitting a
						creature's tentacle that is wrapped around an ally might make it easier for the ally to escape.
						Hitting a foe in the eye might blind it for one round. Hitting a creature in its one vulnerable
						spot might ignore Armor.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Usually, the GM just has the desired minor effect occur. For example, rolling
					a 19 against a relatively weak foe means it is knocked off the cliff. The effect makes the round
					more exciting, but the defeat of a minor creature has no significant impact on the story. Other
					times, the GM might rule that an additional roll is needed to achieve the effect&mdash;the special
					roll only gives the PC the opportunity for a minor effect. This mostly happens when the desired
					effect is very unlikely, such as pushing a 50-ton battle automaton off a cliff. If the player just
					wants to deal 3 additional points of damage as the minor effect, no extra roll is needed.</p>
				<h5 id="special-rolls-major-effect">Major Effect <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#special-rolls-major-effect" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>A major effect happens when a player rolls a natural 20. Most of the time, a major effect is quite
					beneficial to the character. A climber gets up the steep slope in half the time. A jumper lands with
					such panache that those nearby are impressed and possibly intimidated. A defender makes a free
					attack on a foe.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Either the GM or the player can come up with a possible major effect that fits
					the situation, but both must agree on what it should be. As with minor effects, don't spend a lot of
					time agonizing over the details of a major effect. In cases where only success or failure matters, a
					major effect might offer the character a one-time asset (a modification of one step) to use the next
					time they attempt a similar action. When nothing else seems appropriate, the GM can simply grant the
					PC an additional action on their turn that same round.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In combat, the easiest and most straightforward major effect is dealing 4
					additional points of damage with an attack. The following are other common major effects for combat.
				</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li><strong>Disarm:</strong> The foe drops one object that it is holding.</li>
					<li><strong>Impair:</strong> For the rest of the combat, all tasks the foe attempts are hindered.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Knock down:</strong> The foe is knocked prone. It can get up on its turn.</li>
					<li><strong>Stun:</strong> The foe loses its next action.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As with minor effects, usually the GM just has the desired major effect occur,
					but sometimes the GM might require an extra roll if the major effect is unusual or unlikely.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="rules-retrying-a-task-after-failure">Retrying a Task after Failure <a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-retrying-a-task-after-failure" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>If a character fails a task (whether it's climbing a wall, picking a lock, trying to figure out a
					mysterious device, or something else) they can attempt it again, but they must apply at least one
					level of Effort when retrying that task. A retry is a new action, not part of the same action that
					failed, and it takes the same amount of time as the first attempt did.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes the GM might rule that retries are impossible. Perhaps a character
					has one chance to convince the leader of a group of thugs not to attack, and after that, no amount
					of talking will stop them.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This rule doesn't apply to something like attacking a foe in combat because
					combat is always changing and fluid. Each round's situation is new, not a repeat of a previous
					situation, so a missed attack can't be retried.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="rules-initial-cost">Initial Cost <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-initial-cost"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>The GM can assign a point cost to a task just for trying it. Called an initial cost, it's simply an
					indication that the task is particularly taxing. For example, let's say a character wants to try a
					Might action to open a heavy cellar door that is partially rusted shut. The GM says that forcing the
					door open is a difficulty 5 task, and there's an initial cost of 3 Might points simply to try. This
					initial cost is in addition to any points the character chooses to spend on the roll (such as when
					applying Effort), and the initial cost points do not affect the difficulty of the task. In other
					words, the character must spend 3 Might points to attempt the task at all, but that doesn't help
					them open the door. If they want to apply Effort to ease the task, they have to spend more points
					from their Might Pool.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Edge helps with the initial cost of a task, just as it does with any
					expenditure from a character's Pool. In the previous example, if the character had a Might Edge of
					2, they would have to spend only 1 point (3 points minus 2 from their Might Edge) for the initial
					cost to attempt the task. If they also applied a level of Effort to open the door, they couldn't use
					their Edge again&mdash;Edge applies only once per action&mdash;so using the Effort would cost the
					full 3 points. Thus, they'd spend a total of 4 points (1 for the initial cost plus 3 for the Effort)
					from their Might Pool.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The rationale of the initial cost rule is that even in the Cypher System,
					where things like Effort can help a character succeed on an action, logic still suggests that some
					actions are very difficult and taxing, particularly for some PCs more than others.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="rules-distance">Distance <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-distance"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Distance is simplified into four basic categories: immediate, short, long, and very long.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Immediate distance</strong> from a character is within reach or within a few steps;
							if a character stands in a small room, everything in the room is within immediate distance.
							At most, immediate distance is 10 feet (3 m). Immediate distance is sometimes referred to as
							close, or even point-blank, particularly when referring to ranges.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>The words "immediate" and "close" can be used interchangeably to talk about distance. If a
						creature or object is within arm's reach of the character, it can be considered both immediate
						and close.</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Short distance</strong> is anything greater than immediate distance but less than 50
							feet (15 m) or so.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Long distance</strong> is anything greater than short distance but less than 100 feet
							(30 m) or so.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Very long distance</strong> is anything greater than long distance but less than 500
							feet (150 m) or so.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Beyond that range, distances are always specified&mdash;1,000 feet (300 m), 1
					mile (1.5 km), and so on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">All weapons and special abilities use these terms for ranges. For example, all
					melee weapons have immediate range&mdash;they are close-combat weapons, and you can use them to
					attack anyone within immediate distance. A thrown knife (and most other thrown weapons) has short
					range. A small handgun also has short range. A rifle has long range.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character can move an immediate distance as a part of another action. In
					other words, they can take a few steps to the light switch and flip it on. They can lunge across a
					small room to attack a foe. They can open a door and step through.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character can <a href="#action-move">move</a> a short distance as their
					entire action for a turn. They can also try to move a long distance as their entire action, but the
					player might have to roll to see if the character slips, trips, or stumbles for moving so far so
					quickly.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">GMs and players don't need to determine exact distances. For example, if the
					PCs are fighting a group of guards, any character can likely attack any foe in the general
					melee&mdash;they're all within immediate range. However, if one trooper stays back to fire a
					blaster, a character might have to use their entire action to move the short distance required to
					attack that foe. It doesn't matter if the trooper is 20 feet (6 m) or 40 feet (12 m) away&mdash;it's
					simply considered short distance. It does matter if the trooper is more than 50 feet (15 m) away
					because that distance would require a long move.</p>

					<p>In rare cases where distances beyond very long are needed, real-world distances are best (1 mile,
						100 kilometers, and so on). However, the following shorthand distances can be useful in some
						settings:</p>
					<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
						<li><strong>Planetary:</strong> On the same planet.</li>

				<h4 id="rules-timekeeping">Timekeeping <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-timekeeping"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Generally, keep time the same way that you normally would, using minutes, hours, days, and weeks.
					Thus, if the characters walk overland for 15 miles (24 km), about eight hours pass, even though the
					journey can be described in only a few seconds at the game table. Precision timekeeping is rarely
					important. Most of the time, saying things like "That takes about an hour" works fine.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This is true even when a special ability has a specific duration. In an
					encounter, a duration of "one minute" is mostly the same as saying "the rest of the encounter." You
					don't have to track each round that ticks by if you don't want to. Likewise, an ability that lasts
					for ten minutes can safely be considered the length of an in-depth conversation, the time it takes
					to quickly explore a small area, or the time it takes to rest after a strenuous activity.</p>

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A round is about five to ten seconds. The length of time is variable because
					sometimes one round might be a bit longer than another. You don't need to measure time more
					precisely than that. You can estimate that on average there are about ten rounds in a minute. In a
					round, everyone&mdash;each character and NPC&mdash;gets to take one action.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">To determine who goes first, second, and so on in a round, each player makes a
					Speed roll called an initiative roll. Most of the time, it's only important to know which characters
					act before the NPCs and which act after the NPCs. On an initiative roll, a character who rolls
					higher than an NPC's target number takes their action before the NPC does. As with all target
					numbers, an NPC's target number for an initiative roll is three times the NPC's level. Many times,
					the GM will have all NPCs take their actions at the same time, using the highest target number from
					among all the NPCs. Using this method, any characters who rolled higher than the target number act
					first, then all the NPCs act, and finally any characters who rolled lower than the target number
					act.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The order in which the characters act usually isn't important. If the players
					want to go in a precise order, they can act in initiative order (highest to lowest), by going around
					the table, by going oldest to youngest, and so on.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>An initiative roll is a d20 roll. Since your initiative depends on how fast you are, if you spend
						Effort on the roll, the points come from your Speed Pool.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">
					<h5 class="og-csrd-header-small" id="rules-initiative-example">Initiative Example <a
							class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-initiative-example" title="Permalink"
							aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
					<p>For example, Charles, Tammie, and Shanna's characters are in combat with two level 2 security
						guards. The GM has the players make Speed rolls to determine initiative. Charles rolls an 8,
						Shanna rolls a 15, and Tammie rolls a 4. The target number for a level 2 creature is 6, so each
						round Charles and Shanna act before the guards, then the guards act, and finally Tammie acts. It
						doesn't matter whether Charles acts before or after Shanna, as long as they think it's fair.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">After everyone&mdash;all PCs and NPCs&mdash;in the combat has had a turn,
						the round ends and a new round begins. In all rounds after the first, everyone acts in the same
						order as they did in the first round. The characters cycle through this order until the logical
						end of the encounter (the end of the fight or the completion of the event) or until the GM asks
						them to make new initiative rolls. The GM can call for new initiative rolls at the beginning of
						any new round when conditions drastically change. For example, if the NPCs gain reinforcements,
						the environment changes (perhaps the lights go out), the terrain changes (maybe part of the
						balcony collapses under the PCs), or something similar occurs, the GM can call for new
						initiative rolls.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Since the action moves as a cycle, anything that lasts for a round ends
						where it started in the cycle. If Umberto uses an ability on an opponent that hinders its
						defenses for one round, the effect lasts until Umberto acts on his next turn.</p>

				<p>Anything that your character does in a round is an action. It's easiest to think of an action as a
					single thing that you can do in five to ten seconds. For example, if you use your dart thrower to
					shoot a strange floating orb, that's one action. So is running for cover behind a stack of barrels,
					prying open a stuck door, using a rope to pull your friend up from a pit, or activating a cypher
					(even if it's stored in your pack).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Opening a door and attacking a security guard on the other side are two
					actions. It's more a matter of focus than time. Drawing your sword and attacking a foe is all one
					action. Putting away your bow and pushing a heavy bookcase to block a door are two actions because
					each requires a different train of thought.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If the action you want to accomplish is not within reach, you can move a
					little bit. Essentially, you can move up to an immediate distance to perform your action. For
					example, you can move an immediate distance and attack a foe, open a door and move an immediate
					distance into the hallway beyond, or grab your hurt friend lying on the ground and pull them back a
					few steps. This movement can occur before or after your action, so you can move to a door and open
					it, or you can open a door and move through it.</p>

					<p>Ultimately, the GM is the arbiter of conflicts that do not involve the PCs. They should be
						adjudicated in the most interesting, logical, and story-based way possible. When in doubt, match
						the level of the NPCs (characters or creatures) or their respective effects to determine the
						results. Thus, if a level 4 NPC fights a level 3 NPC, the level 4 NPC will win, but if they face
						a level 7 NPC, they'll lose. Likewise, a level 4 creature resists poisons or devices of level 3
						or lower but not those of level 5 and above.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">The essence is this: in the Cypher System, it doesn't matter if something
						is a creature, a poison, or a gravity-dispelling ray. If it's a higher level, it wins; if it's a
						lower level, it loses. If two things of equal level oppose each other, there might be a long,

				<h4 id="rules-action-attack">Action: Attack <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-action-attack"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>An attack is anything that you do to someone that they don't want you to do. Slashing a foe with a
					curved dagger is an attack, blasting a foe with a lightning artifact is an attack, wrapping a foe in
					magnetically controlled metal cables is an attack, and controlling someone's mind is an attack. An
					attack almost always requires a roll to see if you hit or otherwise affect your target.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In the simplest kind of attack, such as a PC trying to stab a thug with a
					knife, the player rolls and compares their result to the opponent's target number. If their roll is
					equal to or greater than the target number, the attack hits. Just as with any kind of task, the GM
					might modify the difficulty based on the situation, and the player might have a bonus to the roll or
					might try to ease the task using skills, assets, or Effort.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A less straightforward attack might be a special ability that stuns a foe with
					a mental blast. However, it's handled the same way: the player makes a roll against the opponent's
					target number. Similarly, an attempt to tackle a foe and wrestle it to the ground is still just a
					roll against the foe's target number.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Attacks are sometimes categorized as "melee" attacks, meaning that you hurt or
					affect something within immediate reach, or "ranged" attacks, meaning that you hurt or affect
					something at a distance.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Melee attacks can be Might or Speed actions&mdash;player choice. Physical
					ranged attacks (such as bows, thrown weapons, and blasts of fire from a mutation) are almost always
					Speed actions, but those that come from special abilities tend to be Intellect actions.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Special abilities that require touching the target require a melee attack. If
					the attack misses, the power is not wasted, and you can try again each round as your action until
					you hit the target, use another ability, or take a different action that requires you to use your
					hands. These attempts in later rounds count as different actions, so you don't have to keep track of
					how much Effort you used when you activated the ability or how you used Edge. For example, let's say
					that in the first round of combat, you activate a special ability that requires you to touch your
					foe and you use Effort to ease the attack, but you roll poorly and miss your foe. In the second
					round of combat, you can try attacking again and use Effort to ease the attack roll.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The GM and players are encouraged to describe every attack with flavor and
					flair. One attack roll might be a stab to the foe's arm. A miss might be the PC's sword slamming
					into the wall. Combatants lunge, block, duck, spin, leap, and make all kinds of movements that
					should keep combat visually interesting and compelling. <a
						href="#chapter-25-running-the-cypher-system">Chapter 25: Running the Cypher System</a> has much
					more guidance in this regard.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Common elements that affect the difficulty of a combat task are cover, range,
					and darkness. The rules for these and other modifiers are explained in the <a

				</div>
				<p>When an attack strikes a character, it usually means the character takes damage.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">An attack against a PC subtracts points from one of the character's stat
					Pools&mdash;usually the Might Pool. Whenever an attack simply says it deals "damage" without
					specifying the type, it means Might damage, which is by far the most common type. Intellect damage,
					which is usually the result of a mental attack, is always labeled as Intellect damage. Speed damage
					is often a physical attack, but attacks that deal Speed damage are fairly rare.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">NPCs don't have stat Pools. Instead, they have a characteristic called health.
					When an NPC takes damage of any kind, the amount is subtracted from its health. Unless described
					otherwise, an NPC's health is always equal to its target number. Some NPCs might have special
					reactions to or defenses against attacks that would normally deal Speed damage or Intellect damage,
					but unless the NPC's description specifically explains this, assume that all damage is subtracted
					from the NPC's health.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Objects don't have stat Pools or health. They have an object damage track,
					just like how PCs have a damage track. Attacking objects might move them down their damage track.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Damage is always a specific amount determined by the attack. For example, a
					slash with a broadsword or a blast with a spike thrower deals 4 points of damage. An <a
						href="#type-adept">Adept</a>'s <a href="#ability-onslaught">Onslaught</a> deals 4 points of
					damage. Often, there are ways for the attacker to increase the damage. For example, a PC can apply
					Effort to deal 3 additional points of damage, and rolling a natural 17 on the attack roll deals 1
					additional point of damage.</p>
				<h5 id="rules-armor">Armor <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#rules-armor" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Pieces of equipment and special abilities protect a character from damage by giving them Armor. Each
					time a character takes damage, subtract their Armor value from the damage before reducing their stat
					Pool or health. For example, if a Warrior with 2 Armor is hit by a gunshot that deals 4 points of
					damage, they take only 2 points of damage (4 minus 2 from their Armor). If Armor reduces the
					incoming damage to 0 or lower, the character takes no damage from the attack. For example, the
					Warrior's 2 Armor protects them from all physical attacks that deal 1 or 2 points of damage.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The most common way to get Armor is to wear <a
						href="#equipment-armor">physical armor</a>, such as a <a
						href="#contemporary-armor-leather-jacket">leather jacket</a>, a <a
						href="#contemporary-armor-kevlar-vest">kevlar vest</a>, a chainmail hauberk, bioengineered
					carapace grafts, or something else, depending on the setting. All physical armor comes in one of
					three categories: light, medium, or heavy. Light armor gives the wearer 1 point of Armor, medium
					gives 2 points of Armor, and heavy gives 3 points of Armor.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When you see the word "Armor" capitalized in the game rules (other than in the
					name of a special ability), it refers to your Armor characteristic&mdash;the number you subtract
					from incoming damage. When you see the word "armor" in lowercase, it refers to any physical armor
					you might wear.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Other effects can add to a character's Armor. If a character is wearing
					chainmail (+2 to Armor) and has an ability that covers them in a protective force field that grants
					+1 to Armor, their total is 3 Armor. If they also use a cypher that hardens their flesh temporarily
					for +1 to Armor, their total is 4 Armor.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some types of damage ignore physical armor. Attacks that specifically deal
					Speed damage or Intellect damage ignore Armor; the creature takes the listed amount of damage
					without any reduction from Armor. Ambient damage (see below) usually ignores Armor as well.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A creature may have a special bonus to Armor against certain kinds of attacks.
					For example, a protective suit made of a sturdy, fire-resistant material might normally give its
					wearer +1 to Armor but count as +3 to Armor against fire attacks. An artifact worn as a helmet might
					grant +2 to Armor only against mental attacks.</p>
				<h5 id="ambient-damage">Ambient Damage <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#ambient-damage"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Some kinds of damage aren't direct attacks against a creature, but they indirectly affect everything
					in the area. Most of these are environmental effects such as winter cold, high temperatures, or
					background radiation. Damage from these kinds of sources is called ambient damage. Physical armor
					usually doesn't protect against ambient damage, though a well-insulated suit of armor can protect
					against cold weather.</p>
				<h5 id="damage-from-hazards">Damage From Hazards <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#damage-from-hazards" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Attacks aren't the only way to inflict damage on a character. Experiences such as falling from a
					great height, being burned in a fire, and spending time in severe weather also deal damage. Although
					no list of potential hazards could be comprehensive, the Damage From Hazards table includes common
					examples.</p>

						href="#the-effects-of-taking-damage" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>When an NPC reaches 0 health, it is either dead or (if the attacker wishes) incapacitated, meaning
					unconscious or beaten into submission.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As previously mentioned, damage from most sources is applied to a character's
					Might Pool. Otherwise, stat damage always reduces the Pool of the stat it affects.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If damage reduces a character's stat Pool to 0, any further damage to that
					stat (including excess damage from the attack that reduced the stat to 0) is applied to another stat
					Pool. Damage is applied to Pools in this order:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Might (unless the Pool is 0)</li>
					<li>Speed (unless the Pool is 0)</li>
					<li>Intellect</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Even if the damage is applied to another stat Pool, it still counts as its
					original type for the purpose of Armor and special abilities that affect damage. For example, if a
					character with 2 Armor is reduced to 0 Might and then is hit by a creature's claw for 3 points of
					damage, it still counts as Might damage, so their Armor reduces the damage to 1 point, which then is
					applied to their Speed Pool. In other words, even though they take the damage from their Speed Pool,
					it doesn't ignore Armor like Speed damage normally would.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In addition to taking damage from their Might Pool, Speed Pool, or Intellect
					Pool, PCs also have a damage track. The damage track has four states (from best to worst): hale,
					impaired, debilitated, and dead. When one of a PC's stat Pools reaches 0, they move one step down
					the damage track. Thus, if they are hale, they become impaired. If they are already impaired, they
					become debilitated. If they are already debilitated, they become dead.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some effects can immediately shift a PC one or more steps on the damage track.
					These include rare poisons, cellular disruption attacks, and massive traumas (such as falls from
					very great heights, being run over by a speeding vehicle, and so on, as determined by the GM).
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some attacks, like a serpent's poisonous bite or a <a
						href="#type-speaker">Speaker</a>'s <a href="#ability-enthrall">Enthrall</a>, have effects other
					than damage to a stat Pool or shifting the PC on the damage track. These attacks can cause
					unconsciousness, paralysis, and so on.
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>When NPCs (who have only health) suffer Speed or Intellect damage, normally this is treated the
						same as Might damage. However, the GM or the player has the option to suggest an appropriate
						alternate effect&mdash;the NPC suffers a penalty, moves more slowly, is stunned, and so on.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="og-csrd-ednote pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Editor's Notes</strong> &mdash; Because damage to an empty pool transfers to another,
						Pool is actually single resource that measures both what PC can do and what they can endure. A
						PC's abilities tend draw from one part of their overall Pool first, but it's not entirely
						off-base to look at using abilities and effort as "taking damage", but in actual fact, it is the
						damage track (detailed below) that functions more like the "hit points" of other games. This
						raises an interesting question:</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Can PC use an ability with an Intellect point cost when their
							Intellect Pool is at 0?</strong></p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">On one hand, ability essentially has an <a
							href="#rules-initial-cost">Initial Cost</a> listed for using it. Moreover, it would
						certainly be difficult to muster <a href="#modifying-the-difficulty-effort">Effort</a> with a
						depleted Pool.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">On the other hand, the damage rules suggest that when subtracting from
						Pools, the cost is deducted from the preferred pool first. Once a PC has moved down the damage
						track, the GM might still allow them to spend points from pools to use abilties. For example, a
						wizard who is out of "mana" (Intellect points) might resort to blood sacrifice, casting spells
						by spending points from their Might Pool instead. A beaten-down warrior whose Might and Speed
						pools are depleted might yet be able to muster a defense&mdash;or final heroic act&mdash;by
						pulling from their sheer willpower (Intellect points). In either case, this is a risky
						strategy&mdash;These PCs are both at risk of quickly moving further down the damage track,
						hastening their own death.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Is it a good ruling? Only your gaming group knows for sure.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="the-damage-track">The Damage Track <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#the-damage-track"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>As noted above, the damage track has four states: hale, impaired, debilitated, and dead.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Hale</strong> is the normal state for a character: all three stat
					Pools are at 1 or higher, and the PC has no penalties from harmful conditions. When a hale PC takes
					enough damage to reduce one of their stat Pools to 0, they become impaired. Note that a character
					whose stat Pools are much lower than normal can still be hale.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Impaired</strong> is a wounded or injured state. When an impaired
					character applies Effort, it costs 1 extra point per level applied. For example, applying one level
					of Effort costs 4 points instead of 3, and applying two levels of Effort costs 7 points instead of
					5.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">An impaired character ignores <a href="#special-rolls-minor-effect">minor</a>
					and <a href="#special-rolls-major-effect">major effect</a> results on their rolls, and they don't
					deal as much extra damage in combat with a special roll. In combat, a roll of 17 or higher deals
					only 1 additional point of damage. When an impaired PC takes enough damage to reduce one of their
					stat Pools to 0, they become debilitated.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Debilitated</strong> is a critically injured state. A debilitated
					character may not take any actions other than to move (probably crawl) no more than an immediate
					distance. If a debilitated character's Speed Pool is 0, they can't move at all. When a debilitated
					PC takes enough damage to reduce a stat Pool to 0, they are dead.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Dead</strong> is dead.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>The damage track allows you to know how far from death you are. If you're hale, you're three
						steps from death. If you're impaired, you're two steps from death. If you're debilitated, you
						are only one small step from death's door.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="recovery-rolls">Recovering Points in a Pool <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#recovery-rolls" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>After losing or spending points in a Pool, you recover those points by resting. You can't increase a
					Pool past its maximum by resting&mdash;just back to its normal level. Any extra points gained go
					away with no effect. The amount of points you recover from a rest, and how long each rest takes,
					depends on how many times you have rested so far that day.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When you rest, make a recovery roll. To do this, roll a d6 and add your tier.
					You recover that many points, and you can divide them among your stat Pools however you wish. For
					example, if your recovery roll is 4 and you've lost 4 points of Might and 2 points of Speed, you can

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The first time you rest each day, it takes only a few seconds to catch your
					breath. If you rest this way in the middle of an encounter, it takes one action on your turn.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The second time you rest each day, you must rest for ten minutes to make a
					recovery roll. The third time you rest each day, you must rest for one hour to make a recovery roll.
					The fourth time you rest each day, you must rest for ten hours to make a recovery roll (usually,
					this occurs when you stop for the day to eat and sleep).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">After that much rest, it's assumed to be a new day, so the next time you rest,
					it takes only a few seconds. The next rest takes ten minutes, then one hour, and so on, in a cycle.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you haven't rested yet that day and you take a lot of damage in a fight,
					you could rest a few seconds (regaining 1d6 points + 1 point per tier) and then immediately rest for
					ten minutes (regaining another 1d6 points + 1 point per tier). Thus, in one full day of doing
					nothing but resting, you could recover 4d6 points + 4 points per tier.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each character chooses when to make recovery rolls. If a party of five PCs
					rests for ten minutes because two of them want to make recovery rolls, the others don't have to make
					rolls at that time. Later in the day, those three can decide to rest for ten minutes and make
					recovery rolls.</p>

				<p>Using points from a <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a> to raise a stat Pool from 0 to 1 or
					higher also automatically moves the character up one step on the damage track.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If all of a PC's stat Pools are above 0 and the character has taken special
					damage that moved them down the damage track, they can use a recovery roll to move up one step on
					the damage track instead of recovering points. For example, a character who is debilitated from a
					hit with a cell-disrupting biotech device can rest and move up to impaired rather than recover
					points in a Pool.</p>
				<h5 id="special-damage">Special Damage <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#special-damage"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>In the course of playing the game, characters face all manner of threats and dangers that can harm
					them in a variety of ways, only some of which are easily represented by points of damage.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Dazed and Stunned:</strong> Characters can be dazed when struck hard
					on the head, exposed to extremely loud sounds, or affected by a mental attack. When this happens,
					for the duration of the daze effect (usually one round), all of the character's tasks are hindered.
					Similar but more severe attacks can stun characters. Stunned characters lose their turn (but can
					still defend against attacks normally).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Poison and Disease:</strong> When characters encounter
					poison&mdash;whether the venom of a serpent, rat poison slipped into a burrito, cyanide dissolved in
					wine, or an overdose of acetaminophen&mdash;they make a Might defense roll to resist it. Failure to
					resist can result in points of damage, moving down the damage track, or a specific effect such as
					paralysis, unconsciousness, disability, or something stranger. For example, some poisons affect the
					brain, making it impossible to say certain words, take certain actions, resist certain effects, or
					recover points to a stat Pool.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Diseases work like poisons, but their effect occurs every day, so the victim
					must make a Might defense roll each day or suffer the effects. Disease effects are as varied as
					poisons: points of damage, moving down the damage track, disability, and so on. Many diseases
					inflict damage that cannot be restored through conventional means.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Paralytic effects cause a character to drop to the
					ground, unable to move. Unless otherwise specified, the character can still take actions that
					require no physical movement.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Other Effects:</strong> Other special effects can render a character
					blind or deaf, unable to stand without falling over, or unable to breathe. Stranger effects might
					negate gravity for the character (or increase it a hundredfold), transport them to another place,
					render them out of phase, mutate their physical form, implant false memories or senses, alter the
					way their brain processes information, or inflame their nerves so they are in constant, excruciating
					pain. Each special effect must be handled on a case-by-case basis. The GM adjudicates how the
					character is affected and how the condition can be alleviated (if possible).</p>
				<h5 id="npcs-and-special-damage">NPCs and Special Damage <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#npcs-and-special-damage" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The GM always has final say over what special damage will affect an NPC. Human NPCs usually react
					like characters, but nonhuman creatures might react very differently. For example, a tiny bit of
					venom is unlikely to hurt a gigantic dragon, and it won't affect an android or a demon at all.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If an NPC is susceptible to an attack that would shift a character down the
					damage track, using that attack on the NPC usually renders it unconscious or dead. Alternatively,
					the GM could apply the debilitated condition to the NPC, with the same effect as it would have on a
					PC.</p>

				<p>In combat situations, many modifiers might come into play. Although the GM is at liberty to assess
					whatever modifiers they think are appropriate to the situation (that's their role in the game), the
					following suggestions and guidelines might make that easier. Often the modifier is applied as a step
					in difficulty. So if a situation hinders attacks, that means if a PC attacks an NPC, the difficulty
					of the attack roll is increased by one step, and if an NPC attacks a PC, the difficulty of the
					defense roll is decreased by one step. This is because players make all rolls, whether they are
					attacking or defending&mdash;NPCs never make attack or defense rolls.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When in doubt, if it seems like it should be harder to attack in a situation,
					hinder the attack rolls. If it seems like attacks should gain an advantage or be easier in some way,
					hinder the defense rolls.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Precise ranges are not important in the Cypher System. The broadly defined "immediate," "short,"
						"long," and "very long" ranges let the GM quickly make a judgment call and keep things moving.
						Basically, the idea is: your target is right there, your target is close, your target is pretty
						far away, or your target is extremely far away.</p>
				</div>
				<h6 id="attack-modifiers-cover">Cover <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#attack-modifiers-cover"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>If a character is behind cover so that a significant portion of their body is behind something
					sturdy, attacks against the character are hindered.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If a character is entirely behind cover (their entire body is behind something
					sturdy), they can't be attacked unless the attack can go through the cover. For example, if a
					character hides behind a thin wooden screen and their opponent shoots the screen with a rifle that
					can penetrate the wood, the character can be attacked. However, because the attacker can't see the
					character clearly, this still counts as cover (attacks against the character are hindered).</p>
				<h6 id="attack-modifiers-position">Position <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#attack-modifiers-position" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Sometimes where a character stands gives them an advantage or a disadvantage.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Prone Target:</strong> In melee, a prone target is easier to hit (attacks against
							them are eased). In ranged combat, a prone target is harder to hit (attacks against them are
							hindered).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Higher Ground:</strong> In either ranged or melee combat, attacks by an opponent on

					</li>
				</ul>
				<h6 id="attack-modifiers-surprise">Surprise <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#attack-modifiers-surprise" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>When a target isn't aware of an incoming attack, the attacker has an advantage. A ranged sniper in a
					hidden position, an invisible assailant, or the first salvo in a successful ambush are all eased by
					two steps. For the attacker to gain this advantage, however, the defender truly must have no idea
					that the attack is coming.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If the defender isn't sure of the attacker's location but is still on guard,
					the attacks are eased by only one step.</p>
				<h6 id="attack-modifiers-range">Range <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#attack-modifiers-range"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>In melee, you can attack a foe who is adjacent to you (next to you) or within reach (immediate
					range). If you enter into melee with one or more foes, usually you can attack most or all of the
					combatants, meaning they are next to you, within reach, or within reach if you move slightly or have
					a long weapon that extends your reach.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The majority of ranged attacks have only two ranges: short range and long
					range (a few have very long range). Short range is generally less than 50 feet (15 m) or so. Long
					range is generally from 50 feet (15 m) to about 100 feet (30 m). Very long range is generally 100
					feet (30 m) to 500 feet (150 m). Greater precision than that isn't important in the Cypher System.
					If anything is longer than very long range, the exact range is usually spelled out, such as with an
					item that can fire a beam 1,000 feet (300 m) or teleport you up to 1 mile (1.5 km) away.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Thus, the game has four measurements of <a
						href="#rules-distance">distance</a>: immediate, short, long, and very long. These apply to <a
						href="#action-move">movement</a> as well. A few special cases&mdash;point-blank range and
					extreme range&mdash; modify an attack's chance to successfully hit.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Point-Blank Range:</strong> If a character uses a ranged weapon against a target
							within immediate range, the attack is eased.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Extreme Range:</strong> Targets just at the limit of a weapon's range are at extreme
							range. Attacks against such targets are hindered.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>The GM might allow a character with a ranged weapon to attack beyond extreme range, but the
						attack would be hindered by two steps for each range category beyond the normal limit. Attacks
						with hard limits, such as the blast radius of a bomb, can't be modified.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">In certain situations, such as a PC on top of a building looking across an
						open field, the GM should allow ranged attacks to exceed their maximum range. For example, in
						perfect conditions, a good archer can hit a large target with a bow and arrow at 500 feet (150
						m), much farther than a bow's typical long range.</p>

				<p>What characters can see (and how well they can see) plays a huge factor in combat.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Dim Light:</strong> Dim light is approximately the amount of light on a night with a
							bright full moon or the illumination provided by a torch, flashlight, or desk lamp. Dim
							light allows you to see out to short range. Targets in dim light are harder to hit. Attacks
							against such targets are hindered. Attackers trained in low-light spotting negate this
							modifier.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Very Dim Light:</strong> Very dim light is approximately the amount of light on a
							starry night with no visible moon, or the glow provided by a candle or an illuminated
							control panel. Very dim light allows you to see clearly only within immediate range and
							perceive vague shapes to short range. Targets in very dim light are harder to hit. Attacks
							against targets within immediate range are hindered, and attacks against those in short
							range are hindered by two steps. Attackers trained in low-light spotting modify these

							these difficulties by two steps in their favor.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Darkness:</strong> Darkness is an area with no illumination at all, such as a

							idea of where the opponent might be, attacks against such targets are hindered by four

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Hiding Target:</strong> A target in dense foliage, behind a screen, or crawling amid

						<p><strong>Invisible Target:</strong> If an attacker can use other senses (such as hearing) to

				<p>When one PC attacks another PC, the attacking character makes an attack roll, and the other character
					makes a defense roll, adding any appropriate modifiers. If the attacking PC has a skill, ability,
					asset, or other effect that would ease the attack if it were made against an NPC, the character adds
					3 to the roll for each step reduction (+3 for one step, +6 for two steps, and so on). If the
					attacker's final result is higher, the attack hits. If the defender's result is higher, the attack
					misses. Damage is resolved normally. The GM mediates all special effects.</p>
				<h5 id="special-situation-area-attacks">Special Situation: Area Attacks <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#special-situation-area-attacks" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Sometimes, an attack or effect affects an area rather than a single target. For example, a grenade or
					a landslide can potentially harm or affect everyone in the area.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In an area attack, all PCs in the area make appropriate defense rolls against
					the attack to determine its effect on them. If there are any NPCs in the area, the attacker makes a
					single attack roll against all of them (one roll, not one roll per NPC) and compares it to the
					target number of each NPC. If the roll is equal to or greater than the target number of a particular
					NPC, the attack hits that NPC.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some area attacks always deal at least a minimum amount of damage, even if the
					attacks miss or if a PC makes a successful defense roll.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, consider a character who uses <a
						href="#ability-shatter">Shatter</a> to attack six cultists (level 2; target number 6) and their
					leader (level 4; target number 12). The PC applies Effort to increase the damage and rolls an 11 for
					the attack roll. This hits the six cultists, but not the leader, so the ability deals 3 points of
					damage to each of the cultists. The description of Shatter says that applying Effort to increase the
					damage also means that targets take 1 point of damage if the PC fails the attack roll, so the leader
					takes 1 point of damage. In terms of what happens in the story, the cultists are caught flat-footed
					by the sudden detonation of one of their knives, but the leader ducks and is shielded from the
					blast. Despite the leader's quick moves, the blast is so intense that a few bits of metal slice
					them.</p>

				<p>Attacking an object is rarely a matter of hitting it. Sure, you can hit the broad side of a barn, but

					PCs.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Intact</strong> is the default state for an object.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Minor damage</strong> is a slightly damaged state. An object with minor damage
							reduces its level by 1.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Major damage</strong> is a critically damaged state. An object with major damage is
							broken and no longer functions.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Destroyed</strong> is destroyed. The object is ruined, no longer functions, and
							cannot be repaired.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If the Might action to damage an object is a success, the object moves one
					step down the object damage track. If the Might roll exceeded the difficulty by 2 levels, the object
					instead moves two steps down the object damage track. If the Might roll exceeded the difficulty by 4
					levels, the object instead moves three steps down the object damage track. Objects with minor or
					major damage can be <a href="#crafting-building-and-repairing">repaired</a>, moving them one or more

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Brittle or fragile objects, like paper or glass, decrease the effective level

					(The GM may rule that some exotic materials add 3.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The tool or weapon used to attack the object must be at least as hard as the

					damage the object no matter what the roll.</p>

				<p>Special abilities are granted by foci, types, and flavors, or provided by cyphers or other devices.
					If a special ability affects another character in any kind of unwanted manner, it's handled as an

					while using an ability, sliding over in combat to take on a different opponent to help a friend,
					pushing through a door they just opened, and so on. This is considered an immediate distance, and a
					character can move this far as part of another action.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In a combat situation, if a character is in a large melee, they're usually
					considered to be next to most other combatants, unless the GM rules that they're farther away
					because the melee is especially large or the situation dictates it.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If they're not in melee but still nearby, they are considered to be a short
					distance away&mdash;usually less than 50 feet (15 m). If they're farther away than that but still
					involved in the combat, they are considered to be a long distance away, usually 50 to 100 feet (15
					to 30 m), or possibly even a very long distance away, usually more than 100 feet to 500 feet (30 to
					150 m).
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In a round, as an action, a character can make a short move. In this case,
					they are doing nothing but moving up to about 50 feet (15 m). Some terrain or situations will change
					the distance a character can move, but generally, making a short move is considered to be a
					difficulty 0 action. No roll is needed; they just get where they're going as their action.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character can try to make a long move&mdash;up to 100 feet (30 m) or
					so&mdash;in one round. This is a Speed task with a difficulty of 4. As with any action, they can use
					skills, assets, or Effort to ease the task. Terrain, obstacles, or other circumstances can hinder
					the task. A successful roll means the character moved the distance safely. Failure means that at
					some point during the move, they stop or stumble (the GM determines where this happens).
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character can also try to make a short move and take another (relatively
					simple) physical action, like make an attack. As with the attempt to make a long move, this is a
					Speed task with a difficulty of 4, and failure means that the character stops at some point,
					slipping or stumbling or otherwise getting held up.
				<h5 id="long-term-movement">Long-Term Movement <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#long-term-movement" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>When talking about movement in terms of traveling rather than round-by-round action, typical
					characters can travel on a road about 20 miles (32 km) per day, averaging about 3 miles (5 km) per
					hour, including a few stops. When traveling overland, they can move about 12 miles (19 km) per day,
					averaging 2 miles (3 km) per hour, again with some stops. Mounted characters, such as those on
					horseback, can go twice as far. Other modes of travel (cars, airplanes, hovercraft, sailing ships,
					and so on) have their own rates of movement.</p>
				<h5 id="movement-modifiers">Movement Modifiers <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#movement-modifiers" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Different environments affect movement in different ways.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Rough Terrain:</strong> A surface that's considered rough terrain is covered in loose
							stones or other material, uneven or with unsure footing, unsteady, or a surface that
							requires movement across a narrow space, such as a cramped corridor or a slender ledge.
							Stairs are also considered rough terrain. Rough terrain does not slow normal movement on a
							round-by-round basis, but hinders move rolls. Rough terrain cuts long-term movement rates in
							half.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Difficult Terrain:</strong> Difficult terrain is an area filled with challenging
							obstacles&mdash;water up to waist height, a very steep slope, an especially narrow ledge,
							slippery ice, a foot or more of snow, a space so small that one must crawl through it, and
							so on. Difficult terrain hinders move rolls and halves movement on a round-by-round basis.
							This means that a short move is about 25 feet (8 m), and a long move is about 50 feet (15
							m). Difficult terrain reduces long-term movement to a third of its normal rate.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Water:</strong> Deep water, in which a character is mostly or entirely submerged,
							hinders move rolls and reduces round-by-round and long-term movement to one quarter its
							normal rate. This means that a short move is about 12 feet(4 m), and a long move is about 25
							feet (7.5 m). Characters trained in swimming halve their movement only while in deep water.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Low Gravity:</strong> Movement in low gravity is easier but not much faster. All move
							rolls are eased.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>High Gravity:</strong> In an environment of high gravity, treat all moving characters
							as if they were in difficult terrain. Characters trained in high-gravity maneuvering negate
							this penalty. High gravity reduces long-term movement to a third of its normal rate.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Zero Gravity:</strong> In an environment without gravity, characters cannot move
							normally. Instead, they must push off from a surface and succeed at a Might roll to move
							(the difficulty is equal to one-quarter the distance traveled in feet). Without a surface to
							push off from, a character cannot move. Unless the character's movement takes them to a
							stable object that they can grab or land against, they continue to drift in that direction
							each round, traveling half the distance of the initial push.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="movement-chase">Special Situation: A Chase <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#movement-chase" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>When a PC is chasing an NPC or vice versa, the player should attempt a Speed action, with the
					difficulty based on the NPC's level. If the PC succeeds at the roll, they catch the NPC (if
					chasing), or they get away (if chased). In terms of the story, this one-roll mechanic can be the
					result of a long chase over many rounds.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Alternatively, if the GM wants to play out a long chase, the character can
					make many rolls (perhaps one per level of the NPC) to finish the pursuit successfully. For every
					failure, the PC must make another success, and if they ever have more failures than successes, the
					PC fails to catch the NPC (if chasing) or is caught (if chased). As with combat, the GM is
					encouraged to describe the results of these rolls with flavor. A success might mean the PC has
					rounded a corner and gained some distance. A failure might mean that a basket of fruit topples over
					in front of them, slowing them down. <a href="#action-vehicular-combat">Vehicle chases</a> are
					handled similarly.</p>

				<p>You can wait to react to another character's action.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You decide what action will trigger your action, and if the triggering action
					happens, you get to take your action first (unless going first wouldn't make sense, like attacking a
					foe before they come into view). For example, if an <a href="#creature-orc">orc</a> threatens you
					with a halberd, on your turn you can decide to wait, stating "If it stabs at me, I'm going to slash
					it with my sword." On the orc's turn, it stabs, so you make your sword attack before that happens.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Waiting is also a good way to deal with a ranged attacker who rises from
					behind cover, fires an attack, and ducks back down. You could say "I wait to see them pop up from
					behind cover and then I shoot them."</p>

				<h4 id="action-defend">Action: Defend <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#action-defend"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Defending is a special action that only PCs can do, and only in response to being attacked. In other
					words, an NPC uses its action to attack, which forces a PC to make a defense roll. This is handled
					like any other kind of action, with circumstances, skill, assets, and Effort all potentially coming
					into play. Defending is a special kind of action in that it does not happen on the PC's turn. It's
					never an action that a player decides to take; it's always a reaction to an attack. A PC can take a
					defense action when attacked (on the attacking NPC's turn) and still take another action on their
					own turn.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The type of defense roll depends on the type of attack. If a foe attacks a
					character with an axe, they can use Speed to duck or block it with what they're holding. If they're
					struck by a poisoned dart, they can use a Might action to resist its effects. If a psi-worm attempts
					to control their mind, they can use Intellect to fend off the intrusion.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes an attack provokes two defense actions. For example, a poisonous
					reptile tries to bite a PC. They try to dodge the bite with a Speed action. If they fail, they take
					damage from the bite, and they must also attempt a Might action to resist the poison's effects.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If a character does not know an attack is coming, usually they can still make
					a defense roll, but they can't add modifiers (including the modifier from a shield), and they can't
					use any skill or Effort to ease the task. If circumstances warrant&mdash;such as if the attacker is
					right next to the character&mdash;the GM might rule that the surprise attack simply hits.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character can always choose to forgo a defense action, in which case the
					attack automatically hits.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some abilities (such as the <a
						href="#ability-countermeasures">Countermeasures</a> special ability) may allow you to do
					something special as a defense action.</p>

				<h4 id="action-do-something-else">Action: Do Something Else <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#action-do-something-else" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Players can try anything they can think of, although that doesn't mean anything is possible. The GM
					sets the difficulty&mdash;that's their primary role in the game. Still, guided by the bounds of
					logic, players and GMs will find all manner of actions and options that aren't covered by a rule.
					That's a good thing.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Players should not feel constrained by the game mechanics when taking actions.
					Skills are not required to attempt an action. Someone who's never picked a lock can still try. The
					GM might hinder the task, but the character can still attempt the action.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Thus, players and GMs can return to the beginning of this chapter and look at
					the most basic expression of the rules. A player wants to take an action. The GM decides, on a scale
					of 1 to 10, how difficult that task is and what stat it uses. The player determines whether they
					have anything that might modify the difficulty and considers whether to apply Effort. Once the final
					determination is made, they roll to see if their character succeeds. It's as easy as that.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As further guidance, the following are some of the more common actions a
					player might take.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Players are encouraged to come up with their own ideas for what their characters do rather than
						looking at a list of possible actions. That's why there is a "do something else" action. PCs are
						not pieces on a game board&mdash;they are people in a story. And like real people, they can try
						anything they can think of. (Succeeding is another matter entirely.) The task difficulty system
						provides GMs with the tools they need to adjudicate anything the players come up with.</p>

				<h5 id="movement-climbing">Climbing <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#movement-climbing"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>

						href="#cooperative-actions" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>There are many ways multiple characters can work together. None of these options, however, can be
					used at the same time by the same characters.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Helping:</strong> If you use your action to help someone with a task, you ease the
							task. If you have an <a href="#key-concepts">inability</a> in a task, your help has no
							effect. If you use your action to help someone with a task that you are trained or
							specialized in, the task is eased by two steps. Help is considered an asset, and someone
							receiving help usually can't gain more than two assets on a single task if that help is
							provided by another character.</p>
						<p>For example, if Scott is trying to climb a steep incline and Sarah (who is trained in
							climbing) spends her turn helping him, Scott's task is eased by two steps.</p>
						<p>Sometimes you can help by performing a task that complements what another person is
							attempting. If your complementary action succeeds, you ease the other person's task. For
							example, if Scott tries to persuade a ship captain to let him on board, Sarah could try to
							supplement Scott's words with a flattering lie about the captain (a deception action), a
							display of knowledge about the region where the ship is headed (a geography action), or a
							direct threat to the captain (an intimidation action). If Sarah's roll is a success, Scott's
							persuasion task is eased.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Distraction:</strong> When a character uses their turn to distract a foe, that foe's
							attacks are hindered for one round. Multiple characters distracting a foe have no greater
							effect than a single character doing so&mdash;a foe is either distracted or not. A
							distraction might be yelling a challenge, firing a warning shot, or a similar activity that
							doesn't harm the foe.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Draw the Attack:</strong> When an NPC attacks a character, another PC can prominently
							present themselves, shout taunts, and move to try to get the foe to attack them instead. In
							most cases, this action succeeds without a roll&mdash;the opponent attacks the prominent PC
							instead of their companions. In other cases, such as with intelligent or determined foes,
							the prominent character must succeed at an Intellect action to draw the attack. If that
							Intellect action is successful, the foe attacks the prominent character, whose defenses are
							hindered by two steps. Two characters attempting to draw an attack at the same time cancel
							each other out.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Take the Attack:</strong> A character can use their action to throw themselves in
							front of a foe's successful attack to save a nearby comrade. The attack automatically
							succeeds against the sacrificial character, and it deals 1 additional point of damage. A
							character cannot willingly take more than one attack each round in this way.</p>
					</li>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#crafting-building-and-repairing" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Crafting is a tricky topic in the Cypher System because the same rules that govern building a spear
					also cover repairing a machine that can take you into hyperspace. Normally, the level of the item
					determines the difficulty of creating or repairing it as well as the time required. For cyphers,
					artifacts, other items that require specialized knowledge, or items unique to a world or species
					other than your own (such as a Martian tripod walker), add 5 to the item's level to determine the
					difficulty of building or repairing it.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes, if the item is artistic in nature, the GM will add to the
					difficulty and time required. For example, a crude wooden stool might be hammered together in an
					hour. A beautiful finished piece might take a week or longer and would require more skill on the
					part of the crafter.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The GM is free to overrule some attempts at creation, building, or repair,
					requiring that the character have a certain level of skill, proper tools and materials, and so
					forth.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A level 0 object requires no skill to make and is easily found in most
					locations. Sling stones and firewood are level 0 items&mdash;producing them is routine. Making a
					torch from spare wood and oil-soaked cloth is simple, so it's a level 1 object. Making an arrow or a
					spear is fairly standard but not simple, so it's a level 2 object.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Generally speaking, a device to be crafted requires materials equal to its
					level and all the levels below it. So a level 5 device requires level 5 material, level 4 material,
					level 3 material, level 2 material, and level 1 material (and, technically, level 0 material).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The GM and players can gloss over much of the crafting details, if desired.
					Gathering all the materials to make a mundane item might not be worth playing out&mdash;but then
					again, it might be. For example, making a wooden spear in a forest isn't very interesting, but what
					if the characters have to make a spear in a treeless desert? Finding the wreckage of something made
					of wood or forcing a PC to fashion a spear out of the bones of a large beast could be interesting
					situations.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The time required to create an item is up to the GM, but the guidelines in the
					crafting table are a good starting point. Generally, repairing an item takes somewhere between half
					the creation time and the full creation time, depending on the item, the aspect that needs
					repairing, and the circumstances. For example, if creating an item takes one hour, repairing it
					takes thirty minutes to one hour.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes a GM will allow a rush job if the circumstances warrant it. This is
					different than using skill to reduce the time required. In this case, the quality of the item is
					affected. Let's say that a character needs to create a tool that will cut through solid steel with a
					laser (a level 7 item), but they have to do it in one day. The GM might allow it, but the device
					might be extremely volatile, inflicting damage on the user, or it might work only once. The device
					is still considered a level 7 item to create in all other respects. Sometimes the GM will rule that
					reducing the time is not possible. For example, a single human can't make a chainmail vest in one
					hour without some kind of machine to help.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Possible crafting skills include:</p>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">
					<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-quick-reference">

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Characters might try to make a cypher, an artifact, or an alien psionic
					starship do something other than its intended function. Sometimes, the GM will simply declare the
					task impossible. You can't turn a vial of healing elixir into a two-way communicator. But most of
					the time, there is a chance of success.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">That said, tinkering with weird stuff is not easy. Obviously, the difficulty
					varies from situation to situation, but difficulties starting at 7 are not unreasonable. The time,
					tools, and training required would be similar to the time, tools, and training needed to repair a
					device. If the tinkering results in a <a href="#experience-points-long-term-benefits">long-term
						benefit</a> for the character&mdash;such as creating an artifact that they can use&mdash;the GM
					should require them to spend XP to make it.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Circumstances really matter. For example, sewing a dress by hand might take five times as long

					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Obviously, what is considered "weird stuff " will vary from setting to
						setting, and sometimes the concept might not apply at all. But many times, there will be
						something in the setting that is too strange, too alien, too powerful, or too dangerous for PCs

				<h5 id="action-guarding">Guarding <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#action-guarding"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>In a combat situation, a character can stand guard as their action. They do not make attacks, but all
					their defense tasks are eased. Further, if an NPC tries to get by them or take an action that they
					are guarding against, the character can attempt an eased Speed action based on the level of the NPC.
					Success means the NPC is prevented from taking the action; the NPC's action that turn is wasted.
					This is useful for blocking a doorway, guarding a friend, and so forth.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If an NPC is standing guard, use the same procedure, but to get past the
					guard, the PC attempts a hindered Speed action against the NPC. For example, Diana is an NPC human
					with a level 3 bodyguard. The bodyguard uses their action to guard Diana. If a PC wants to attack
					Diana, the PC first must succeed at a difficulty 4 Speed task to get past the guard. If the PC
					succeeds, they can make their attack normally.</p>
				<h5 id="action-healing">Healing <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#action-healing"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>You can administer aid through bandaging and other succor, attempting to heal each patient once per
					day. This healing restores points to a stat Pool of your choice. Decide how many points you want to
					heal, and then make an Intellect action with a difficulty equal to that number. For example, if you
					want to heal someone for 3 points, that's a difficulty 3 task with a target number of 9.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-ednote pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Editor's Notes</strong> &mdash; The GM might consider placing limitations on healing
						actions, hindering the task for each successive attempt to healing a target that day. So if you

					works much like punching them or affecting them with an ability. This is true of persuading someone,

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you run an immediate distance before jumping, it counts as an asset, easing
					the jump.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you run a short distance before jumping, divide the jump distance (in feet)
					by 2 and then subtract 4 to determine the difficulty of the jump. Because you're running an
					immediate distance (and then some), you also count your running as an asset. For example, jumping a
					distance of 20 feet (6 m) with a short running start has a difficulty of 5 (20 feet divided by 2 is
					10, minus 4 is 6, minus 1 for running an immediate distance).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For a vertical jump, the distance you clear (in feet) is equal to the

				<p>Generally, the GM will describe any sight or sound that's not purposefully difficult to detect. But
					if you want to look for a hidden enemy, search for a secret panel, or listen for someone sneaking up
					on you, make an Intellect roll. If it's a creature, its level determines the difficulty of your
					roll. If it's something else, the GM determines the difficulty of your roll.</p>

				<p>You can push or pull something very heavy and move it an immediate distance as your action.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The weight of the object determines the difficulty of the Might roll to move
					it; every 50 pounds (23 kg) hinders the task by one step. So moving something that weighs 150 pounds
					(68 kg) is difficulty 3, and moving something that weighs 400 pounds (180 kg) is difficulty 8. If
					you can ease the task to 0, you can move a heavy object up to a short distance as your action.</p>

				<p>As with figuring out a device, the level of the device usually determines the difficulty of the
					Intellect roll. Unless a device is very complex, the GM will often rule that once you figure it out,
					no roll is needed to operate it except under special circumstances. So if the PCs figure out how to
					use a hovercraft, they can operate it. If they are attacked, they might need to roll to ensure that
					they don't crash the vehicle into a wall while trying to avoid being hit.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Unlike operating a device, disabling a device or picking a lock usually
					require rolls. These actions often involve special tools and assume that the character is not trying
					to destroy the device or lock. (A PC who <em>is</em> attempting to destroy it probably should make a
					Might roll to smash it rather than a Speed or Intellect roll requiring patience and know-how.)</p>

						href="#action-vehicular-movement" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p><a href="#choose-science-fiction-vehicles">Vehicles</a> move just like creatures. Each has a movement
					rate, which indicates how far it can move in a round. Most vehicles require a driver, and when
					moving, they usually require that the driver spends every action controlling the movement. This is a
					routine task that rarely requires a roll. Any round not spent driving the vehicle hinders the task
					in the next round and precludes any change in speed or direction. In other words, driving down the
					road normally is difficulty 0. Spending an action to retrieve a backpack from the back seat means
					that in the following round, the driver must attempt a difficulty 1 task. If they instead use their
					action to pull a handgun from the backpack, in the next round the difficulty to drive will be 2, and
					so on. Failure results are based on the situation but might involve a collision or something
					similar.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In a vehicular chase, drivers attempt Speed actions just like in a regular
					chase, but the task may be based either on the level of the driver (modified by the level and
					movement rate of the vehicle) or on the level of the vehicle (modified by the level of the driver).
					So if a PC driving a typical car is chasing a level 3 NPC driving a level 5 <a
						href="#vehicle-car-sports">sports car</a>, the PC would make three chase rolls with a difficulty
					of 5. If the PC's car is a souped-up custom vehicle, it might grant the PC an asset in the chase. If
					the PC is not in a car at all, but riding a bicycle, it might hinder the chase rolls by two or three
					steps, or the GM might simply rule that it's impossible.</p>
				<h5 id="action-vehicular-combat">Vehicular Combat <a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#action-vehicular-combat" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Much of the time, a fight between foes in cars, boats, or other <a
						href="#choose-science-fiction-vehicles">vehicles</a> is just like any other combat situation.
					The combatants probably have cover and are moving fast. Attacks to disable a vehicle or a portion of
					it are based on the level of the vehicle. If the vehicle is an armored car or a tank, all attacks
					are likely aimed at the vehicle, which has a level and probably an appropriate Armor rating, not
					unlike a creature.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The only time this isn't true is with battles where only vehicles and not
					characters are involved. Thus, if the PCs are in a shootout with bank robbers and both groups are in
					cars, use the standard rules. However, battles between starships of various kinds&mdash;from
					gigantic capital ships to single-pilot fighters&mdash;are a frequent occurrence in far-future
					science fiction settings. A submarine battle between two deep sea craft could be quite exciting.
					Characters in a modern-day game might find themselves in a tank fight. If PCs are involved in combat
					in which they are entirely enclosed in vehicles (so that it's not really the characters fighting,
					but the vehicles), use the following quick and easy guidelines.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">On this scale, combat between vehicles isn't like traditional combat. Don't
					worry about health, Armor, or anything like that. Instead, just compare the levels of the vehicles
					involved. If the PCs' vehicle has the higher level, the difference in levels is how many steps the
					PCs' attack and defense rolls are eased. If the PCs' vehicle has the lower level, their rolls are
					hindered. If the levels are the same, there is no modification.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">These attack and defense rolls are modified by skill and Effort, as usual.
					Some vehicles also have <a href="#extended-vehicular-combat-base-combat-task-modifiers">superior
						weapons</a>, which ease the attack (since there is no "damage" amount to worry about), but this
					circumstance is probably uncommon in this abstract system and should not affect the difficulty by
					more than one or maybe two steps. Further, if two vehicles coordinate their attack against one
					vehicle, the attack is eased. If three or more vehicles coordinate, the attack is eased by two
					steps.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The attacker must try to target a specific system on or portion of an enemy
					vehicle. This hinders the attack based on the system or portion targeted.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">That's a lot of modifications. But it's not really that hard. Let's look at an
					example of a space battle. A PC in a small level 2 fighter attacks a level 4 frigate. Since the
					frigate is level 4, the difficulty of the attack starts at 4. But the attacking craft is weaker than
					the defender, so the attack is hindered equal to the difference in their levels (2). The fighter
					pilot must make a difficulty 6 attack on the frigate. However, the fighter is trying to swoop in and
					damage the frigate's drive, which hinders the attack by another three steps, for a total difficulty
					of 9. If the fighter pilot is trained in space combat, they reduce the difficulty to 8, but it's
					still impossible without help. So let's say that two other PCs&mdash;also in level 2
					fighters&mdash;join in and coordinate their attack. Three ships coordinating an attack on one target
					eases the task by two steps, resulting in a final difficulty of 6. Still, the attacking PC would be
					wise to use Effort.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Then the frigate retaliates, and the PC needs to make a defense roll. The
					level difference between the ships (2) means the PC's defense is hindered by two steps, so the
					difficulty of the PC's defense roll starts out at 6. But the frigate tries to take out the fighter's
					weapons, hindering their attack (easing the PC's defense) by two steps. Thus, the PC needs to
					succeed at a difficulty 4 task or lose their main weapons systems.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It's important to remember that a failed attack doesn't always mean a miss.
					The target ship might rock and reel from the hit, but the bulk of the damage was absorbed by the
					shields, so there's no significant damage.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This bare-bones system should allow the GM and players to flesh out exciting
					encounters involving the whole group. For example, perhaps while one PC pilots a ship, another mans
					the guns, and another frantically attempts to repair damage to the maneuvering thrusters before they
					crash into the space station they're trying to defend.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>During a vehicular battle, particularly a space battle, there's a lot of chatter about shields
						failing, hull integrity, being outmaneuvered, coming in too fast, and whatnot. These sorts of
						details are great, but they're all flavor, so they're represented in the rules generally, rather
						than specifically.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Training in driving makes the character practiced in using a vehicle as a
						weapon. If the vehicle is used to run over a victim or ram an enemy vehicle, treat a motorcycle
						as a medium weapon and treat a car or truck as a heavy weapon.</p>

							href="#followers" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
					<p>Player characters have the option to gain followers as they advance in tier, as provided by type
						or focus special abilities. Followers do not need to be paid, fed, or housed, though a character
						who gains followers can certainly make such arrangements if they wish. A follower is someone
						whom a character has inspired (or asked) to come work with the character for a time, aiding them
						in a variety of endeavors. A follower puts the PC's interests ahead of, or at least on par with,
						their own.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">The PC generally makes rolls for their follower when the follower takes
						actions, though usually a follower's modifications provide an asset to a specific action taken
						by the PC they follow.</p>
					<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
						<li>
							<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> A follower can <a href="#cooperative-actions">help</a> a
								PC in one or more tasks, granting the PC an asset to that task. The level of the
								follower indicates the number of different tasks they can help with. The tasks that the
								follower is able to help with are predetermined, usually chosen by the PC when they gain
								the follower. A level 2 follower who the player determines is a spy could grant a PC an
								asset on two different tasks, such as stealth and deception. Followers cannot help with
								tasks that they don't have modifications for; for the purpose of helping, treat the
								follower as if they had inabilities in all nonmodified tasks.</p>
							<p>When the follower acts autonomously rather than helping the PC, they act like a normal
								NPC that has modifications. Thus, the modification increases their effective level for
								the associated task by one step. For example, the level 2 spy follower with
								modifications for stealth and deception attempts stealth and deception tasks as if they
								were level 3 and all other tasks as level 2.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Follower Assets to Combat and Defense:</strong> A follower cannot grant an asset
								to a character's attacks or defense until the follower is level 3 or higher. Even then,
								the follower can help with attacks and defense only if they have a modification for that
								kind of task.</p>
							<p>Some abilities may grant a special exception to this rule. For instance, the Serv-0
								Defender ability gives your level 1 Serv-0 follower (a machine companion) a modification
								for Speed defense.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Follower Level Progression:</strong> A follower increases in level by 1 each time
								a PC advances two tiers after gaining that follower. When the follower gains a level,
								the PC also chooses the task that the follower gains a modification for.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Exceptional Follower:</strong> When a character gains a follower, there's a small
								chance that the follower will be exceptional in some way, a cut above other followers of
								their kind. The GM determines when an exceptional follower is found, possibly as an
								additional reward for smart or engaging roleplaying where the PCs impress or otherwise
								positively interact with one or more NPCs, some of whom may later go on to become one of
								their followers. An exceptional follower has the same qualities as a regular follower
								but is 1 level higher.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Pet:</strong> Any PC can potentially gain a pet, though a pet typically doesn't
								provide modifications. If a character wants a pet that can do this, they must gain the
								pet through an ability or focus that grants followers. On the other hand, a
								well-cared-for pet grants an asset to a PC's tasks related to achieving peace of mind,
								finding comfort, and resisting loneliness.</p>

					<p>The modifications provided by followers could come across as fairly dry and mechanical. To avoid
						that, you could present each follower in a way that makes them more compelling and interesting.
						Here are a few examples of how to describe a follower, depending on their mix of modifications.
					</p>
					<ul>

				<p>Experience points (XP) are the currency by which players gain benefits for their characters. The most

					Sometimes experience points are earned during a game session, and sometimes they're earned between

					2 XP (on average). The exact amounts depend on the events of the session.</p>

						href="#experience-points-gm-intrusion" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>At any time, the GM can introduce an unexpected complication for a character. When they intrude in
					this way, they must give that character 2 XP. That player, in turn, must immediately give one of
					those XP to another player and justify the gift (perhaps the other player had a good idea, told a
					joke, or performed an action that saved a life).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Often, the GM intrudes when a player attempts an action that should be an
					automatic success. However, the GM is free to intrude at other times. As a general rule, the GM
					should intrude at least once each session, but no more than once or twice each session per
					character.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Anytime the GM intrudes, the player can spend 1 XP to refuse the intrusion,
					though that also means they don't get the 2 XP. If the player has no XP to spend, they can't refuse.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If a player rolls a 1 on a die, the GM can intrude without giving the player
					any XP.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Through skill and the aid of another character, a fourth-tier PC
							eases a wall-climbing task from difficulty 2 to difficulty 0. Normally, they would succeed
							at the task automatically, but the GM intrudes and says "No, a bit of the crumbling wall
							gives way, so you still have to make a roll." As with any difficulty 2 task, the target
							number is 6. The PC attempts the roll as normal and gains 2 XP because the GM intruded. They
							immediately give one of those XP to another player.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> During a fight, a PC swings their axe and damages a foe with a
							slice across the shoulder. The GM intrudes by saying that the foe turned just as the axe
							struck, wrenching the weapon from the character's grip and sending it clattering across the
							floor. The axe comes to a stop 10 feet (3 m) away. Because the GM intruded, the PC gains 2
							XP, and the player immediately gives one of those XP to another player. Now the character
							must deal with the dropped weapon, perhaps drawing a different weapon or using their next
							turn to scramble after the axe.</p>

				<h4 id="character-arcs">Character Arcs<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#character-arcs"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Character arcs are the means by which players can invest themselves more in great stories and
					character depth and development.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Just like in a book or a television show, characters progress through their
					own personal story and change over time. A PC with a character arc decides for themselves what they
					do and why. Character arcs are like stated goals for a character, and by progressing toward that
					goal, the character advances. The key word there is progressing. A PC doesn't have to succeed at
					achieving the goal to earn advancement&mdash;it's not an all-or-nothing prospect. Each arc is keyed
					to a single character, but just like in a book or show, characters can take part in the larger story
					arc that the whole group participates in, while also progressing in their own personal arc.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Character arcs have different steps that mark the character's progress through
					the arc. Each arc eventually reaches a climax, and then finishes with a step that is a final
					resolution. Each step reached earns the character 2 XP. Character arcs are the most straightforward
					way that a character earns XP.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Typically, PCs will earn about half their total experience points from arcs or other GM awards.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">At character creation, a player can choose one character arc for their PC at
					no cost. Players have the option to not choose one, but it's probably a good idea to do so. First
					and foremost, it is a character-defining factor. If they begin the campaign with a desire to find
					the woman who killed their brother, that says a lot about the character: they had a brother, he was
					likely close to them, he had been in at least one dangerous situation, and the character is probably
					motivated by anger and hate, at least somewhat. Even after the character finishes this first arc,
					they'll undoubtedly have (at least one) more because they can gain new arcs as the campaign
					progresses.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Once play begins, players can take on a new arc whenever they wish, as fits
					the character's ongoing story. Taking a new arc has a cost of 1 XP. While there's no hard limit on
					how many arcs a character can have at one time, realistically most PCs couldn't reasonably have more
					than three or four.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">However, as mentioned above, arcs have a beginning cost that must be paid,
					reflecting the character's devotion to the goal. The character will earn this investment back
					(probably many times over) if the arc is completed.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Character arcs are always player-driven. A GM cannot force one on a character.
					That said, the events in the narrative often present story arc opportunities and inspire character
					arcs for the PCs. It's certainly in the GM's purview to suggest possible arcs related to the events
					going on. For example, if the GM presents an encounter in which an NPC wishes to learn from the PC,
					it might make sense to suggest taking the Instruction arc. Whether or not the PC takes on the
					student, the player doesn't have to adopt the Instruction arc unless they want to.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">At the end of a session, review the actions you took and describe how they
					might equate to the completion of a step (or possibly more than one step) in their character arc. If
					the GM agrees, the character gets their reward.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>When in doubt, if one character accomplishes a step in their arc but another character does not,

						get, at minimum, 1 XP for the session.</p>

						href="#experience-points-gm-awards" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Sometimes, a group will have an adventure that doesn't deal primarily with a PC's character arc. In
					this case, it's a good idea for the GM to award XP to that character for accomplishing other tasks.
					First and foremost, awards should be based on discovery. Discovery can include finding a significant
					new location, such as a hidden chamber, a secret fortress, a lost land, a new planet, or an
					unexplored dimension. In this fashion, PCs are explorers. Discovery can also include a new
					significant aspect of a setting, such as a secret organization, a new religion, and so on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It can also mean finding a new procedure or device (something too big to be
					considered a piece of equipment) or even previously unknown information. This could include a source
					of magical power, a unique teleportation device, or the cure for a plague. These are all
					discoveries. The common thread is that the PCs discover something that they can understand and put
					to use.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Last, depending on the GM's outlook and the kind of campaign the group wants
					to play, a discovery could be a secret, an ethical idea, an adage, or even a truth.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>It's a fine line, but ultimately the GM decides what constitutes a discovery as opposed to just
						something weird in the course of an adventure. Usually, the difference is, did the PCs
						successfully interact with it and learn something about it? If so, it's probably a discovery.
					</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Artifacts:</strong> When the group gains an artifact, award XP equal to the
							artifact's level and divide it among the PCs (minimum 1 XP for each character). Round down
							if necessary. For example, if four PCs discover a level 5 artifact, they each get 1 XP.
							Money, standard equipment, and cyphers are not worth XP.</p>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Experience point awards for artifacts should usually apply even if the artifact was given to the
						PCs rather than found, because often such gifts are the rewards for success.</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Miscellaneous Discoveries:</strong> Various other discoveries might grant 1 XP to
							each PC involved.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Other Awards:</strong> If a character is focused on activities that don't relate to a
							character arc or a discovery, as a general rule, a mission should be worth at least 1 XP per
							game session involved in accomplishing it. For example, saving a family on an isolated farm
							beset by raiding cultists might be worth 1 XP for each character. Of course, saving the
							family doesn't always mean killing the bad guys; it might mean relocating them, parlaying
							with the cultists, or chasing off the raiders.</p>

				<h4 id="spending-experience-points">Spending Experience Points<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#spending-experience-points" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Experience points are meant to be used. Hoarding them is not a good idea; if a player accumulates
					more than 10 XP, the GM can require them to spend some.
				<p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Generally, experience points can be spent in four ways: immediate benefits,
					short- and medium-term benefits, long-term benefits, and <a href="#character-advancement">character
						advancement</a>.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Experience points should not be a goal unto themselves. Instead, they are a game mechanic to
						simulate how&mdash;through experience, time, toil, travail, and so on&mdash; characters become
						more skilled, more able, and more powerful. Spending XP to explain a change in a character's
						capabilities that occurred in the course of the story, such as if the PC made a new device or
						learned a new skill, isn't a waste of XP&mdash;it's what XP are for.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="experience-points-immediate-benefits">Immediate Benefits<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#experience-points-immediate-benefits" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The most straightforward way for a player to use XP is to reroll any roll in the game&mdash;even one
					that they didn't make. This costs 1 XP per reroll, and the player chooses the best result. They can
					continue to spend XP on rerolls, but this can quickly become an expensive proposition. It's a fine
					way to try to prevent disaster, but it's not a good idea to use a lot of XP to reroll a single
					action over and over.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A player can also spend 1 XP to refuse a GM intrusion.</p>
				<h5 id="experience-points-short-and-medium-term-benefits">Short- and Medium-Term Benefits<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#experience-points-short-and-medium-term-benefits"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>By spending 2 XP, a character can gain a skill&mdash;or, more rarely, an ability&mdash;that provides
					a short-term benefit. Let's say a character notices that the computer terminals in the facility
					they're infiltrating are similar to those used by the company they once worked for. They spend 2 XP
					and say that they have a great deal of experience in using these. As a result, they are trained in
					operating (and breaking into) these computers. This is just like being trained in computer use or
					hacking, but it applies only to computers found in that particular location. The skill is extremely
					useful in the facility, but nowhere else.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Medium-term benefits are usually story based. For example, a character can
					spend 2 XP while climbing through mountains and say that they have experience with climbing in
					regions like these, or perhaps they spend the XP after they've been in the mountains for a while and
					say that they've picked up the feel for climbing there. Either way, from now on, they're trained in
					climbing in those mountains. This helps them now and any time they return to the area, but they're
					not trained in climbing everywhere.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This method allows a character to get immediate training in a skill for half
					the normal cost. (Normally, it costs 4 XP to become trained in a skill.) It's also a way to gain a
					new skill even if the PC has already gained a new skill as a step toward attaining the next tier.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In rare cases, a GM might allow a character to spend 2 XP to gain an entirely
					new ability&mdash;such as a device, a special ability, or a special mental power&mdash;for a short
					time, usually no longer than the course of one scenario. The player and the GM should agree on a
					story-based explanation for the benefit. Perhaps the ability has a specific rare requirement, such
					as a tool, a battery, a drug, or some kind of treatment. For example, a character who wants to
					explore a submerged location has several biotech enhancements, and they spend 2 XP to cobble
					together a device that lets them breathe underwater. This gives them the ability for a considerable
					length of time, but not permanently&mdash;the device might work for only eight hours. Again, the
					story and the logic of the situation dictate the parameters.</p>
				<h5 id="experience-points-long-term-benefits">Long-Term Benefits<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#experience-points-long-term-benefits" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>In many ways, the long-term benefits a PC can gain by spending XP are a means of integrating the
					mechanics of the game with the story. Players can codify things that happen to their characters by
					talking to the GM and spending 3 XP.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Things that a PC can acquire as a long-term benefit can be thought of as being
					story based, and they allow the player to have some narrative control over the story. In the course
					of play, a player might decide that their character gains a friend (a contact) or builds a log cabin
					(a home). Because a player spent XP, however, they should have some agency over what they've gained,
					and it shouldn't be easily taken away. The player should help come up with the details of the
					contact or the design of their home.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It's also possible to gain these benefits through events in the story, without
					spending XP. The new contact comes to the PC and starts the relationship. The new home is granted to
					them as a reward for service to a powerful or wealthy patron, or maybe the character inherits the
					home from a relative. However, because these came from the GM and not the player (and no XP were
					spent), the player has no narrative control over them and the GM makes up the details.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Long-term benefits can include the following.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Contact:</strong> The character gains a long-term NPC contact of
							importance&mdash;someone who will help them with information, equipment, or physical tasks.
							The player and GM should work out the details of the relationship.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Home:</strong> The PC acquires a full-time residence. This can be an apartment in a
							city, a cabin in the wilderness, a base in an ancient complex, or whatever fits the
							situation. It should be a secure place where the PC can leave their belongings and sleep
							soundly. Several characters could combine their XP and buy a home together.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Title or job:</strong> The PC is granted a position of importance or authority. It
							might come with responsibilities, prestige, and rewards, or it might be an honorary title.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Wealth:</strong> The PC comes into a considerable amount of wealth, whether it's a
							windfall, an inheritance, or a gift. It might be enough to buy a home or a title, but that's
							not really the point. The main benefit is that the PC no longer needs to worry about the
							cost of simple equipment, lodging, food, and so on. This wealth could mean a set
							amount&mdash;perhaps 50,000 dollars (or whatever is appropriate in the setting)&mdash;or it
							could bestow the ability to ignore minor costs, as decided by the player and GM.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>GMs and players should work together to make XP awards and expenditures fit the ongoing story. If
						a PC stays in a location for two months to learn the inhabitants' unique language, the GM might
						award the character a few XP, which are then immediately spent to grant them the ability to
						understand and speak that language.</p>

				<p>Progressing to the next tier involves four steps. When a PC has spent 4 XP on each of the steps, they
					advance to the next tier and gain all the type and focus benefits of that tier. The four steps can
					be purchased in any order, but each can be purchased only once per tier. In other words, a PC must
					buy all four steps and advance to the next tier before they can buy the same steps again.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">

						<p>If you choose a skill that you are already trained in, you become specialized in that skill,

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Other Options:</strong> Players can also spend 4 XP to purchase other special

							The special options are as follows:</p>
						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">

					<p><strong>Editor's Notes</strong> &mdash; It is a common struggle to get past advancement feature
						and use XP for short-, medium- or long-term benefits and <a href="#player-intrusions">player
							intrusions</a>. Here are a few ways a GM can use to encourage players to spend (and earn)
						more XP!</p>
					<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
						<li>
							<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Some consistent XP&mdash;just for showing up makes it easier
								to spend some.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Character Arcs:</strong> Reserve some time at the end of each session to talk
								about the PC's <a href="#character-arcs">character arcs</a>, and assign a XP value for
								any steps completed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Equal Advancement:</strong> Consider using <a href="#equal-advancement">Equal
									Advancement</a> rules, or that XP for character advancement XP be distributed in
								reseponse to "milestones" of the campaign, for example: making a significant discovery,
								completing a quest or story, or reaching the end of a character arc.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>GM Intrusions:</strong> GM intrusions generate a lot XP, so if you are a GM, use
								them. If you are a player, accept them! The GM might even consider granting XP even when
								a GM intrusion is the result of a player rolling a 1 on the die. Aim to offer at least
								one GM intrusion to each player every session.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h5 id="equal-advancement">Equal Advancement<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#equal-advancement"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>It's worthwhile if all characters advance through the six tiers at about the same rate&mdash;an
					important issue for some players. A good GM can achieve this result by carefully handing out XP
					rewards, some during play (which will tend to get used immediately) and some after play concludes,
					especially after completing a major story arc or quest so the GM can hand out 4 XP in one go (which
					will tend to get used for advancement). Many groups will discover while playing that equal
					advancement isn't an important issue in the Cypher System, but people should get to play the game
					the way they want to play it.
				<h5 id="tier-advancement-in-the-cypher-system">Tier Advancement in the Cypher System<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#tier-advancement-in-the-cypher-system" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Tiers in the Cypher System aren't entirely like levels in other roleplaying games. In the Cypher
					System, gaining tiers is not the players' only goal or the only measure of achievement. Starting
					(first-tier) characters are already competent, and there are only six tiers. Character advancement
					has a power curve, but it's only steep enough to keep things interesting. In other words, gaining a
					new tier is cool and fun, but it's not the only path to success or power. If you spend all your XP
					on immediate, short-term, and medium-term benefits, you will be different from someone who spends
					their points on <a href="#experience-points-long-term-benefits">long-term benefits</a>, but you will
					not be "behind" that character.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The general idea is that most characters will spend half their XP on tier
					advancement and long-term benefits, and the rest on immediate benefits and short- and medium-term
					benefits (which are used during gameplay). Some groups might decide that XP earned during a game is
					to be spent on immediate and short- and medium-term benefits (gameplay uses), and XP awarded between
					sessions for discoveries is to be spent on character advancement (long-term uses).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Ultimately, the idea is to make experience points into tools that the players
					and the GM can use to shape the story and the characters, not just a bookkeeping hassle.</p>

				<h4 id="sample-character-arcs">Sample Character Arcs<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#sample-character-arcs" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>The rest of this chapter presents sample character arcs for PCs. The writeup of each arc describes
					the parts involved in progressing through the arc:</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Opening:</strong> This sets the stage for the rest of the arc. It involves some
							action, although that might just be the PC agreeing to do the task or undertake the mission.
							It usually has no reward.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Step(s):</strong> This is the action required to move toward the climax. In story
							terms, this is the movement through the bulk of the arc. It's the journey. The rising
							tension. Although there might be just one step, there might also be many, depending on the
							story told. Each results in a reward of 2 XP.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Climax:</strong> This is the finale&mdash;the point at which the PC likely succeeds
							or fails at what they've set out to do. Not every arc ends with victory. If the character is
							successful, they earn a reward of 4 XP. If they fail, they still earn a reward of 2 XP. If a
							character fails the climax, they very likely ignore the resolution.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> This is the wrap-up or denouement. It's a time for the character
							to reflect on what happened, tie up any loose ends, and figure out what happens next. When
							things are more or less resolved, the character earns a 1 XP reward.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Within the arc, most of the time a part is probably optional, depending on the
					situation&mdash;although it's hard to envision most arcs without some kind of opening, climax, or
					resolution. Steps other than the opening, the climax, and the resolution can be done in any order.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Character arcs should always take at least weeks in game time, and no more
					than two parts in an arc should be accomplished in a game session (and most of the time, it should
					be one part, if any). If neither of these two things is true, then it's not really a character arc.
					You can't, for example, use the Creation arc to guide you through something you can make in an hour
					or two.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The following are common character arcs that you can choose for your

					<li>
						<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Collecting your reward (if any) and conferring with the people

				<p>Someone close to you or important to you in some way has been wronged. The most overt version of this
					arc would be to avenge someone's death. Avenging is different than revenge, as revenge is
					personal&mdash;you are the wronged party. But in the Avenge character arc, you are avenging a wrong
					done to someone else.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Opening:</strong> Declaration. You publicly declare that you are going to avenge the

					<li>
						<p><strong>Step(s):</strong> Tracking the Guilty. You track down the guilty party. This might
							not be physically finding them if you already know where they are. Instead, it might be
							discovering a way to get at them if they are distant, difficult to reach, or well protected.
							This step might be repeated multiple times, if applicable.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Step:</strong> Finding the Guilty. You finally find the guilty party, or find a path

				<p>You want to get closer to another character. This might be to make a friend, find a mentor, or

				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Opening:</strong> Drawing up a Plan. What's your goal, and how are you going to

							other than yourself are needed to begin, and how many will you need to sustain things once
							they are up and running?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Step:</strong> Finding a Location. You probably need a place to run your
							enterprise&mdash;a store, a workshop, a base of operations, and so on. You find a location
							and look into what it will take to buy or rent it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Step(s):</strong> Building the Enterprise. You procure the needed equipment or
							personnel. You make the connections and deals to get things started. You obtain important

							Each of these developments (and likely others) can be counted as a separate step, so there
							will be many steps.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Climax:</strong> Profit and Loss. You determine whether your enterprise will take off

				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Opening:</strong> Assessment. You assess yourself as well as who you need to prove

						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>This is an odd character arc in that it's (presumably) not something that a character would want. It
					is something that a player selects on a meta level for the character because it makes for an
					interesting story. It also sets up the potential for future arcs, such as <a
						href="#arc-redemption">Redemption</a>. It's important that this involve actions you take. For
					example, you fall into substance abuse. You treat people badly. You make mistakes that endanger
					others. In other words, the fall isn't orchestrated by someone else&mdash;it's all your own doing.

				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>

						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Willingly or unwillingly, you are going to change. This is another meta arc. It's less about a goal
					and more about character development. While it's possible that the growth involved is intentional,

					better leader, or experience some other form of growth.</p>

					<li>

					</li>
					<li>

				<p>You teach a pupil. You have knowledge on a topic and are willing to share. This can be a skill, an
					area of lore, a combat style, or the use of a special ability. This is usually a fairly long-term
					arc. Sometimes teaching a pupil is a side matter, and sometimes the pupil takes on more of an

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Step(s):</strong> The Lessons. Teaching is often a slow, gradual process.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Step:</strong> Breakdown. Many times, a student needs to have a moment of crisis to
							really learn something. Maybe they get dejected, or maybe they rebel against your teaching
							techniques.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Climax:</strong> Graduation. This is when you recognize that the pupil has learned

							reach, or well protected. This step might be repeated multiple times, if applicable.</p>

				<p>You don't know who your parents were, but you want to find out. The mystery might be something other

					Fantasy
				</h3>
				<p>For our purposes, fantasy is any genre that has magic, or something so inexplicable it might as well
					be magic. The sort of core default of this type is Tolkienesque fantasy, also known as second-world
					fantasy because it includes a completely new world not our own. Big fantasy epics like those penned
					by J. R. R. Tolkien (hence the name), C. S. Lewis, George R. R. Martin, Stephen R. Donaldson, David
					Eddings, Ursula K. Le Guin, and others are indicative of this genre. It usually involves swords,
					sorcery, nonhuman species (such as elves, dwarves, helborn, and half-giants), and epic struggles.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Of course, fantasy might also involve the modern world, with creatures of myth
					and sorcerers dwelling among us. It might involve mythic traditions of any number of cultures
					(elves, dwarves, and the like, usually being decidedly European) or bear little resemblance to
					anything on Earth, past or present. It might even involve some of the trappings of science fiction,
					with spaceships and laser guns amid the wizardry and swords (this is often called science fantasy).
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Fantasy can also be defined by the amount of fantasy elements within it. A
					second-world fantasy filled with wizards, ghosts, dragons, curses, and gods is referred to as high
					fantasy. Fantasy with a firmer grounding in reality as we know it in our world is low fantasy. (In
					fact, low fantasy often takes place in our world, or in our world's distant past, like the stories
					of Conan.) No single element indicates concretely that a given fantasy is high or low. It's the
					prevalence of those elements.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The point is, there are many, many types of fantasy.</p>

				<h4 id="optional-rule-spellcasting">Optional Rule: Spellcasting<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#optional-rule-spellcasting" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Fantasy settings prioritize magic as an essential ingredient. But why restrict that magic to just
					wizards and similar characters? It's not uncommon in fantasy literature for a thief or warrior to
					learn a few spells as they steal or brawl through their adventures. Leiber's Gray Mouser knew some
					spells, Moorcock's Elric knew a lot, pretty much everyone in Anthony's Xanth books knew at least
					one, and so on. Of course, wizards and sorcerers specialize in spellcasting, which gives them clear
					superiority in magic use. But whether a character is a fireball-flinging wizard or a belligerent
					barbarian, anyone can learn some spellcasting under this optional rule.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Under the spellcasting rule, any character, no matter their role or type, can
					choose to learn a spell as a <a href="#experience-points-long-term-benefits">long-term benefit</a>.
					After they learn one spell, they may learn more later if they wish, or just stick with the one.</p>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">

						Spontaneous Spellcasting<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
							href="#spellcasting-prepared-vs-spontaneous-spellcasting" title="Permalink"
							aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
					<p>Magical characters get their abilities (which might be spells, rituals, or something else) from
						their type and focus, and they can use these abilities as they see fit as long as they spend the
						required Pool points. This technically makes them more like spontaneous casters. If you'd like
						to play something more like a prepared-caster wizard with a large selection of abilities that
						you narrow down each day, consider a spellcasting-oriented focus like <a
							href="#focus-channels-divine-blessings">Channels Divine Blessings</a>, <a
							href="#focus-masters-spells">Masters Spells</a>, or <a
							href="#focus-speaks-for-the-land">Speaks for the Land</a>, and consider augmenting it with
						the optional spellcasting rule.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="spellcasting-first-spell">First Spell<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#spellcasting-first-spell" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Any character can gain a spell by spending 3 XP and working with the GM to come up with an in-game
					story of how the PC learned it. Maybe they learned it as a child from their parent and practiced it
					enough to actually do it; perhaps they spent a month hiding in a wizard's library reading; it could
					be that they found a weird magical amulet that imbues them with the spell; and so on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Next, choose one low-tier ability from <a href="#chapter-9-abilities">Chapter
						9: Abilities</a>. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, the character gains that ability as their
					spell, with a few caveats. The spell can't be used like a normal ability gained through a PC's type
					or focus. Instead, a character must either use a <a href="#recovery-rolls">">recovery roll</a> or
					spend many minutes or longer evoking their spell, in addition to paying its Pool cost (if any).</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Using a Recovery Roll to Cast a Spell:</strong> If the character uses a one-action,
							ten-minute, or one-hour <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a> as part of the same
							action to cast the spell (including paying any Pool costs), they can use the ability as an
							action. This represents a significant mental and physical drain on the character, because
							the normal benefit of recovering points in a Pool is not gained.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Spending Time to Cast a Spell:</strong> If the character takes at least ten minutes
							chanting, mumbling occult phonemes, concentrating deeply, or otherwise using all their
							actions, they can cast a low-tier spell (if they also pay any Pool costs). An hour is
							required to cast mid-tier spells. Ten hours are required to cast a high-tier spell.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="spellcasting-more-spells">More Spells<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#spellcasting-more-spells" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Once a character has learned at least one spell, they can opt to learn additional spells later. Each
					time, they must spend an additional 3 XP and work with the GM to come up with an in-game story of
					how the character's magical learning has progressed.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Two additional rules for learning additional spells apply:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>First, a character must be at least tier 3 and have previously gained one low-tier spell before
						they can learn a mid-tier spell.</li>
					<li>Second, a character must be at least tier 5 and have previously gained one mid-tier spell before
						they can learn a high-tier spell.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Otherwise, gaining and casting additional spells are as described for the
					character's first spell.</p>
				<h5 id="wizards-and-the-optional-spellcasting-rule">Wizards and the Optional Spellcasting Rule<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#wizards-and-the-optional-spellcasting-rule"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Wizards (usually <a href="#type-adept">Adepts</a>) and characters with explicit spellcasting foci
					like <a href="#focus-masters-spells">Masters Spells</a>, <a
						href="#focus-channels-divine-blessings">Channels Divine Blessings</a>, <a
						href="#focus-speaks-for-the-land">Speaks for the Land</a>, and possibly others are also
					considered to be spellcasters, and moreover, specialized ones. Their spells&mdash;abilities provided
					by their type or focus&mdash;are used simply by paying their Pool costs. Extra time or physical
					effort isn't required to cast them. That's because, in the parlance of the fantasy genre, these
					spells are considered to be "prepared."</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">But specialized casters can also use the optional spellcasting rule to expand
					their magic further. They can learn additional spells via the optional spellcasting rule just like
					other characters, with the same limitations.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Optionally, specialized casters who record their arcane knowledge in a
					spellbook (or something similar) gain one additional benefit. The spellbook is a compilation of
					spells, formulas, and notes that grants the specialized caster more flexibility than those who've
					simply learned a spell or two. With a spellbook, a PC can replace up to three prepared spells with
					three other spells they've learned of the same tier. To do so, they must spend at least one
					uninterrupted hour studying their spellbook. Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind,
					and must be done soon after a ten-hour recovery.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For instance, if a wizard exchanges <a href="#ability-ward">Ward</a> (an
					ability gained from their type) with <a href="#ability-telekinesis">Telekinesis</a> (an ability
					gained from the optional spellcasting rule), from now on the character can cast <a

				<p>If the setting calls for wuxia-style fantasy martial arts or similar types of action, you can make a
					few rule changes to portray the kinds of things characters in such stories can accomplish.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Running and climbing speeds and jumping distances are doubled.</strong> For those
							trained in running, climbing, or jumping, the speeds and distances are tripled instead of
							doubled. For those specialized, they are quintupled. For all intents and purposes, this
							means that everyone can run up a wall or jump very high in the air, and masters can
							practically fly or run across water.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Everyone knows kung fu.</strong> Unless a person is a simple farmer, herder, or
							merchant, they know how to fight with elaborate and powerful martial arts styles. This
							doesn't change anything in the game mechanically&mdash;no one gets the ability to use
							weapons that they wouldn't normally have under the rules. But it does change the flavor,
							suggesting that no PC is entirely ignorant of weapons or close combat.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Players are encouraged to come up with interesting names for their martial arts
								abilities.</strong> Instead of using a Bash attack, perhaps it is "The Three-Flower
							Fist," and instead of Fury, a character uses "The Rage of the Sevenfold." It is reasonable
							for high-tier martial abilities such as <a href="#ability-amazing-effort">Amazing
								Effort</a>, <a href="#ability-jump-attack">Jump Attack</a>, or <a
								href="#ability-finishing-blow">Finishing Blow</a> to be described with a magical
							flare&mdash; blazing auras of fire, brilliant cascades of light, ethereal figures overlaying
							the character, and so on.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Materials and objects are easier to destroy.</strong> For the purpose of attacking
							objects, subtract 2 from the level of any material (minimum of 0). It should be relatively
							simple for any character to smash through a plain wooden door with little effort, and true
							warriors can shatter stones with their blows.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Wounds heal faster.</strong> Everyone gains +1 to all <a
								href="#recovery-rolls">recovery rolls</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Superhuman abilities exist.</strong> Consider adopting some of the superhero rules
							from the Cypher System Reference Document, in particular the <a
								href="#optional-rule-power-shifts">Power Shifts</a> optional rule. These may derive from
							almost supernatural levels of training in various techniques (such as dianxue) but probably
							mostly from neili.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Dianxue:</strong> The touch of death&mdash;killing by using precise nonlethal force on

				<p>Creating a low-level cypher is easier than creating a high-level one. The character decides what
					level of cypher they're trying to create, which must be in the level range for the cypher as listed
					in the Cypher System Reference Document. Note that some cyphers have the same effect no matter what
					level they are, so the character could make crafting easier by creating the lowest-level version of
					that cypher, but the GM is always able to rule that a particular cypher must be crafted at a certain
					level or higher for it to work. In particular, a stim is very strong for its level range, and should
					always be treated as a level 6 cypher when crafted by a PC.</p>

						href="#crafting-magic-items-cyphers-step-3" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>The difficulty of a magic item crafting task is always equal to 1 + the level of the cypher. The
					crafter can reduce the assessed difficulty of a crafting task with skill training (such as being
					trained or specialized in brewing potions or scribing scrolls), assets, special abilities provided
					by their focus or type, and so on. Using a formula, recipe, or other guideline for a specific cypher
					counts as an asset for this purpose. Because this is an activity requiring special knowledge, it is
					not possible for a character with no skill (or with an <a href="#key-concepts">inability</a> in this
					skill) to do this sort of crafting; the character cannot attempt the task at all.</p>
				<h6 id="crafting-magic-items-cyphers-step-4">4. Determine Time to Craft.<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#crafting-magic-items-cyphers-step-4" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>The amount of time it takes to craft a magical cypher is determined by the assessed difficulty, so
					decreasing the assessed difficulty not only means the character is more likely to succeed, but also
					that they have to spend less time on crafting it. See the table below.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For any time in excess of nine hours, the process is assumed to have stages
					where the character is not actively working on it, just checking on it occasionally to make sure
					everything is going as planned&mdash; allowing the base ingredients of a potion to cook for a few
					hours, stirring to make sure the ingredients don't congeal, allowing ink on a scroll to dry, and so
					on. In other words, the character is able to perform other actions in the vicinity of the crafting
					(such as studying, resting, eating, and so on), but couldn't craft on the road or in the middle of a

						href="#crafting-magic-items-cyphers-step-5" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The crafting character must complete multiple subtasks that are steps toward
					finishing the process. The number of subtasks required is equal to the assessed difficulty of the
					crafting task attempted. So a crafting task assessed as difficulty 5 requires five subtask
					successes.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The difficulty of each individual subtask begins at 1 and increases by one
					step for each remaining subtask, until the crafter succeeds on the final, highest-difficulty
					subtask. Generally, subtask attempts occur at equally divided intervals over the course of the full
					time required to craft the item.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If at any point the crafter fails on a subtask, the item isn't ruined.
					Instead, the character only wasted the time spent on that subtask, and can spend that much time
					again and then try to succeed at that same subtask. If the crafter fails twice in a row on the same
					subtask, the character can continue crafting, but in addition to losing another interval of crafting
					time, more crafting material (equal to one of the kind of item needed to craft it) is destroyed in a
					mishap and must be replaced before crafting can continue.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A player may ask to apply Effort to each subtask. Applying Effort is something
					they do in the moment, not over the course of days or weeks. Generally speaking, Effort cannot be
					applied to any crafting task or subtask that exceeds one day</p>
				<h5 id="crafting-magic-items-artifacts">Crafting Artifacts<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#crafting-magic-items-artifacts" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Crafting an artifact is similar to choosing a new type or focus ability&mdash;the character has many
					to choose from, they select the one that best fits their intention, and thereafter they can use the
					artifact much like they'd use any of their other character abilities. The main difference is that
					most artifacts don't cost Pool points to activate, and character abilities don't have a depletion
					stat that eventually removes the item from play. Crafting artifacts is handled as a <a
						href="#experience-points-long-term-benefits">long-term benefit</a> of <a
						href="#character-advancement">character advancement</a>; the character and GM agree on the
					artifact to be crafted, and the character spends 3 XP. If the item is fairly simple, the GM can skip
					the crafting details and just say that after a period of time, the PC creates the artifact. For an
					item that significantly alters gameplay&mdash;granting the character vast telepathic powers or
					giving them the ability to teleport at will&mdash;the GM can give the item an assessed difficulty
					equal to 3 + the artifact level and require the character to follow the crafting steps for creating
					a magical cypher. Crafting this kind of artifact takes up to five times as many materials and up to
					twenty times as long as crafting a cypher of the same assessed difficulty.</p>

				<p>Ritual magic has two aspects related to time: how long it takes to prepare the ritual, and how long
					it takes to perform it. The preparation time is how long it takes to get ready to perform the
					ritual. The performance time is how long the ritual takes from start to finish, once the
					preparations (if any) are complete.</p>
				<h5 id="ritual-magic-difficulty-and-subtasks">Difficulty and Subtasks<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#ritual-magic-difficulty-and-subtasks" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Completing a ritual has an overall difficulty level, usually equal to the level of the challenge.
					Sometimes there isn't a clear idea of what level the challenge should be&mdash; teleporting a group
					of people to a nearby city and raising a person from the dead don't have an obvious task level. In
					these cases, the GM should choose a level for the ritual based on what would make an interesting
					experience for the players. Instead of having the success or failure of this sort of magic come down
					to one roll, ritual magic lets the GM build tension by requiring the players to make rolls for
					multiple subtasks. The subtasks start at difficulty 1, and the subtask difficulty increases by 1
					each time until the players make a final roll at the highest difficulty. A ritual with an overall
					difficulty of 4 has four subtasks, with the first one at difficulty 1, the second at difficulty 2,
					the third at 3, and the last one at 4.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If at any point the PC fails a subtask, the ritual isn't automatically ruined,
					but it costs time&mdash;a failure means the time spent on that subtask was wasted, but the character
					can spend that much time again and try to succeed at that same subtask. The GM may decide that later
					attempts at that subtask are hindered, or that a certain number of failures during the ritual
					(perhaps equal to half the ritual's overall level) means the whole thing needs to be started again.
					Skills, assets, and other special abilities can ease subtasks just like they do with any other task
					(which might make some of the subtasks routine and not require a roll at all). Characters may apply
					Effort to each subtask.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some rituals might require the PCs to spend points from their Pools on each
					subtask, with Might representing blood or vitality, Speed representing energy, and Intellect
					representing will or sanity. Multiple PCs involved in the ritual could collectively contribute to
					this cost (and if a ritual costs many points, spreading out the cost in this way may be necessary to
					prevent a participating PC from dying during the ritual).</p>
				<h5 id="ritual-magic-accelerated-performance">Accelerated Performance<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#ritual-magic-accelerated-performance" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The GM may allow a character to speed up a ritual, reducing the time required for one or more
					subtasks. Generally, reducing a subtask's time by half should hinder the subtask, and reducing it by
					half again (reducing the time needed to a quarter of the normal amount) should hinder the subtask by
					an additional step (two steps total). The minimum amount of time for a subtask is 1 round (unless
					the subtask is routine, in which case the GM may allow it to take no time at all).</p>
				<h5 id="example-rituals">Example Rituals<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#example-rituals"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The following are examples of common magical rituals suitable for many fantasy settings. Specific
					details of a ritual may vary depending on what the characters are trying to accomplish; for example,
					a ritual to ask a demon for a favor might be similar to one used to ask an angel, but the exact
					details are probably very different. Everything listed in a ritual is merely a suggestion, and the
					GM should alter, add, or remove whatever they like to suit their campaign.</p>
				<h6 id="ritual-beseech">Beseech<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#ritual-beseech" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Call upon a powerful supernatural entity such as a deity, archangel, demon lord, or ancient elemental
					to ask for a favor that the entity can and is likely to do (nothing it would ethically oppose). If
					the ritual is successful, the entity makes its attention known, such as by manifesting as a light,
					noise, or visible spirit. It may ask for more information, for a task or favor in return, or for a
					service to be named later. The entity is not compelled to do the favor; the ritual merely gains its
					attention and gives the characters the opportunity to speak their case.</p>

					<p><strong>Editor's Notes</strong> &mdash; </p>
					<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
						<li>
							<p><strong>Armor Ratings:</strong> The Armor rating and Speed Effort Additional Cost ratings
								for Full Plate and Scale have been altered in this presentation to what are the assumed
								correct values given the listed price of the item, correcting a misprint from page 37 of
								<em>Godforsaken</em> from Monte Cook Games.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Shields:</strong> Unlike many games, the Cypher System doesn't provide any
								limitations on what kinds of characters can use a shield. However, shields do require a
								free hand to use, and Adept abilities require at least one free hand unless the GM says
								otherwise, as established in the sidebar for <a href="#first-tier-adept">First-Tier
									Adept</a>.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Beastskin:</strong> An improved form of hides and furs, usually crafted from a
							creature with especially tough skin such as a giant lizard or rhinoceros.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Breastplate:</strong> A fitted metal plate or set of plates that protect your torso
							but not your arms or legs, giving you greater movement than full plate at the cost of some
							protection.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Brigandine:</strong> Long strips of metal attached to a cloth or leather backing.
							Often called "splint mail."</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Chainmail:</strong> Mail armor made from hundreds of interlocking metal rings or
							links. Often called "chain" or "chain armor."</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Dwarven breastplate:</strong> A high-quality breastplate crafted by a skilled dwarf,
							providing good protection and great mobility. Dwarven breastplate is medium armor (2 Armor)
							but encumbers the wearer as if it were light armor (it has a Speed Effort cost of 1). Not
							all dwarf-crafted breastplates count as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled
							dwarven smiths know how to make it).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Elven chainmail:</strong> A high-quality suit of chainmail crafted by a skilled elf,
							providing good protection and excellent mobility. Elven chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor)
							but is no more encumbering than a typical outfit of normal clothing (it has no Speed Effort
							cost). Not all elf-crafted chainmail counts as this type of armor (only exceptionally
							skilled elven smiths know how to make it).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Full plate:</strong> A complete suit of fitted metal plates that give excellent
							coverage and protection against attacks. The joints are protected by small layered plates
							over flexible chain. Sometimes called "plate mail."</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Heavy cloth:</strong> Clothing that's heavy enough to reduce the effect of attacks
							against you, such as winter clothing or a fashionable leather outfit. Heavy cloth provides 1
							Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks
							like clubs or hammers. Heavy cloth doesn't have a Speed Effort cost. It can't be worn with
							other kinds of armor.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Hides and furs:</strong> Made from thick or poorly cured animal skins. It's heavier
							and bulkier than other kinds of leather armor, but easier to make, especially by
							resource-poor crafters.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Leather jerkin:</strong> Armor made of hardened pieces of leather (usually boiled or
							treated with chemicals) that mainly covers your torso. It's stiffer than leather used for
							clothing, but still flexible enough that you can bend and twist in it. Some jerkins are
							reinforced with metal studs (and may be called "studded leather"), and brigandine improves
							upon that concept.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Padded:</strong> Cloth armor that is deliberately designed with multiple layers to be
							thick and protective. This is sometimes called "quilted armor" because it is a layer of
							padding sewn between two layers of cloth. Padded armor provides 1 Armor against piercing or
							slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers.
							Padded armor doesn't have a Speed Effort cost. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Scale:</strong> Mail armor made from overlapping scales or plates attached to a
							leather or cloth backing. Often called "scale mail."</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Shield:</strong> Provides an asset to Speed defense rolls. Shield sizes vary from a
							small buckler to a large kite shield (in the Cypher System, the difference is mainly flavor,
							and for game purposes they all grant the wearer the same benefit). You must have one free
							hand to use a shield.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>If the GM prefers the simpler method of not tracking whether an attack is bashing, slashing, or
						stabbing, heavy cloth and padded armor should provide no Armor at all.</p>

							or skims the book for at least ten minutes before attempting the task (this assumes the
							character has already read the book and is looking for relevant information).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Caltrops, bag:</strong> A bag of hard things you scatter on the ground to slow or
							injure anyone walking through an area. One bag covers an immediate area and makes that area
							count as <a href="#movement-modifiers">difficult terrain</a>. A creature can safely move
							through it as if it were difficult terrain (half speed). If a creature moves through the
							area at normal speed, they must make a difficulty 2 Speed defense roll or take 2 points of

							Provides an asset on healing tasks. Some parts are reusable, but the kit runs out after
							about five uses.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Lamp:</strong> A hollow container filled with oil that slowly burns to provide light
							(often resembling a "genie lamp"). A lamp creates normal light in an immediate area and dim
							light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L)
							of oil. If dropped, it might spill oil, break, or both.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Lantern:</strong> An improved version of a lamp, with a wick that draws oil and glass
							or metal panes to protect it from wind. A lantern creates normal light in an immediate area
							and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint
							(.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it is less likely to spill than a lamp.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Lockpicks:</strong> Also known as thieves' tools, this set provides everything a
							skilled person needs to pick locks and disarm traps.</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Oil:</strong> A pint (.5 L) of lamp oil in a leather flask. It burns for three to
							four hours in a lantern or lamp. If prepped with a burning wick, it can be thrown,
							inflicting fire damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). If poured on a flat surface, it
							makes an immediate area slippery. A creature can safely move through the oil slick as if it
							were <a href="#movement-modifiers">difficult terrain</a> (half speed). If a creature moves
							through the area at normal speed, they must make a difficulty 3 Speed defense roll or slip
							on the oil and fall prone. Lighting the oil slick makes it burn for one or two rounds and
							inflicts 1 point of fire damage (ignores Armor) on anyone in or moving through the area.</p>

						href="#fantasy-rules-awarding-treasure" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>It's best to think of gold and magic as two different kinds of currencies that characters have access
					to.</p>
				<h6 id="fantasy-rules-awarding-treasure-gold">Gold<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#fantasy-rules-awarding-treasure-gold" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>The Cypher System abstracts item costs into general categories&mdash; inexpensive, moderate,
					expensive, and so on. Starting characters generally have access to only a few inexpensive and
					moderate items and perhaps one or two expensive items. In a typical fantasy campaign, the characters
					should become wealthier as they advance.</p>
				<h6 id="fantasy-rules-awarding-treasure-manifest-cyphers">Manifest Cyphers<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#fantasy-rules-awarding-treasure-manifest-cyphers"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>The expectation is that PCs will use cyphers often because they'll have many opportunities to get
					more; if the players can exploit this mechanic by selling off most of their cyphers in town, they're
					abusing the rules to make gold. The GM might be tempted to discourage this behavior by reducing how
					often the PCs gain new cyphers, but that goes against the premise of cyphers in the game: they
					should be common enough that the PCs use them freely instead of hoarding them. The key to addressing
					this selling-cyphers wealth problem is to make it harder to sell or trade cyphers for gold.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The PCs can have opportunities to trade their cyphers with NPCs in town,
					whether that's at a magic item shop, the tower of a mentor wizard, a thieves' guild, a temple, other
					adventurers, or the local government. The kinds of cyphers these NPCs can offer may be limited in
					theme (such as a benevolent church that makes healing potions and trades them for other useful
					cyphers) or quantity (such as having only one or two cyphers available each month). Two cyphers of
					the same level are generally considered to be about the same value, although local biases and NPC
					interests may affect their willingness to trade certain items despite or because of a level
					disparity.</p>
				<h6 id="fantasy-rules-awarding-treasure-artifacts">Artifacts<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#fantasy-rules-awarding-treasure-artifacts" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Artifacts are the high end of magical currency, and in terms of buying and selling them, they're like
					manifest cyphers: not something a typical NPC can use, and beyond what a typical NPC can afford, but
					they could be traded for a different artifact of about the same level. Unlike cyphers, the game
					doesn't assume that PCs have frequent opportunities to gain new artifacts or replace the ones that
					deplete.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In a pinch, an artifact is worth the equivalent of one or two very expensive
					items or one exorbitant item, depending on what the artifact can do. An artifact that grants an
					asset to one kind of roll is probably worth about as much as a very expensive item, one that adds +1
					Armor might be worth two expensive items, and a strong defensive or offensive artifact could be
					worth about the same as an exorbitant item.</p>
				<h5 id="fantasy-rules-magical-technology">Magical Technology<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#fantasy-rules-magical-technology" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>To craft items of magical technology in a setting where they are commonplace, use the standard rules
					for crafting regular (nonmagical) items.</p>

						href="#fantasy-rules-magic-plus-technology" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Whatever technology exists in the setting could be magically enhanced if magic is also present. Such
					items would almost certainly be manifest cyphers or artifacts. Here's an example cypher:</p>
				<h6 id="fantasy-cypher-frozen-timepiece">

						<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Creates or transforms into a pocket watch that seems to be made of

							move through the world and take actions that affect themselves or their own belongings
							(bandage a wound, repair a broken item, and so on). The effect lasts for one round per
							cypher level.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">And here's an example artifact:</p>
				<h6 id="fantasy-artifact-truth-binoculars">

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Form:</strong> Pair of binoculars with a large runic symbol on them</p>

					<li>
						<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Not only do these make it easy to see things far away, but looking

						<p><strong>Depletion:</strong> 1&ndash;2 in 1d100 (check each use)</p>

				<p>To craft items that are both technological and magical, either you need to make the device first and
					then enchant it, or you need to enchant it as it is made. Either way, the skills for making the
					device and for making it magical are likely very different.</p>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#fantasy-rules-technology-that-interacts-with-magic"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>In a world with scientists and engineers faced with the presence of real magic, some of them would
					develop ways to interact and cope with it. Technological devices that are not magical but deal with
					magic could include:</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">

						<p><strong>Mystical hazard suit (very expensive):</strong> This full-body protective suit is
							cumbersome and clumsy, not unlike a hazmat suit. However, all of the wearer's tasks to
							resist magical effects are eased. If the wearer takes even 1 point of physical damage, the
							suit rips and no longer functions until it is repaired and resealed.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Spellscrambler (very expensive):</strong> Essentially a sonic grenade, this device
							produces a variety of strange electromagnetic signals&mdash;some audible and very loud, some
							not&mdash;on a number of frequencies. The mental processes needed to cast a spell are
							impossible to achieve for one round within a short distance of the device. Like any grenade,
							it can be used only once.</p>

				<p>In a world where magic and technology coexist, wizards will have spells and effects that protect them

				<p>From a rules perspective, mind control is fairly straightforward: one creature decides what actions
					another creature takes (perhaps limited in that the controlled creature won't take actions that harm

					controlled creature's head&mdash;whether during the effect or afterward&mdash;often isn't specified.
					There are several options for the GM to consider, either for all kinds of mind-control magic or on a
					case-by-case basis.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Confusion:</strong> The controlled creature doesn't understand why they're doing

							thoughts and actions. Once the control is over, the creature may admit that they don't know
							why they did those things, or come up with an explanation justifying (to themselves and
							others) their reasons for those actions.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Dream:</strong> The controlled creature is aware of what's going on but perceives it
							in a dreamlike state. They may believe that they're in control of themselves the entire
							time, or somewhat aware that they're not fully in control (similar to being intoxicated by
							drugs or alcohol or disoriented by an illness). Afterward, the creature might feel strange
							about the events but may not realize that someone else was controlling them.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Trapped:</strong> The active thoughts in the controlled creature's head come from the
							controller, but the creature still has a small voice or awareness in the background, like
							they're a prisoner in their own mind. This horrible situation usually means the controlled
							creature reverts to normal once the control is gone, and is probably very upset that their
							mind and body autonomy were violated.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">One way to present mind control more safely is to disallow certain actions but
					otherwise leave the character in control. For example, being charmed by a vampire might mean the PC
					can't attack the vampire (or its allies) or run away, but is still able to call for help, heal
					themselves, leave at a normal pace, and take other actions. Alternatively, the character can be
					given a specific command, and until they comply with that command their other actions are hindered
					by one or more steps. If the player is willing to engage with the parameters of the mind control,
					the GM may award them an additional 1 XP (or, to approach it from the opposite direction, the GM can
					offer them a <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> that the mind control is happening, and allow
					the player to spend 1 XP to refuse it, or go into XP debt if they want to refuse it but have no XP
					to spend).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A rule for any game: don't use mind control (or anything) to make a character
					have sex without the player's permission.</p>

				<h5 id="fantasy-rules-possession">Possession<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#fantasy-rules-possession" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Some creatures (demons, ghosts, entities of living mental energy, and so on) have the ability to
					possess a living person, taking over a character's body as if it were the creature's own. The
					creature must touch the character to attempt possession (even if the creature's touch normally
					inflicts damage, the possession attempt doesn't inflict damage). The character must make an
					Intellect defense roll or become possessed, whereupon the creature's immaterial form disappears into
					the character.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The first round in which a character is possessed, they can act normally. In
					the second and all subsequent rounds, the possessing creature can try to control the actions of the
					host, but the character can attempt an Intellect defense roll to resist each suggested action.
					Successful resistance means that the character does nothing for one round. When the creature isn't
					trying to control the host, the character can act as they choose. Usually, a possessing creature's
					actions are limited to controlling its host and leaving the host (the creature's own abilities are
					unavailable to it while in someone else's body).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">While it possesses a character, the creature is immune to most direct attacks
					(though not so the host; killing the host will eject the creature). For example, hitting a
					demon-possessed human with a sword hurts only the human, not the demon controlling them. Mental
					attacks and special abilities that only affect possession or the type of possessing creature usually
					work normally</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A possessed character is allowed an Intellect defense roll to eject the
					creature once per day. The defense roll is hindered by one additional step each day of possession
					after the first seven days. An ejected, cast-out, or exorcised demon is powerless for one or more
					days. One way to exorcise a demon is to command it out in the name of an entity that has power over
					the demon. This can be attempted once per day and grants the possessed character an additional
					Intellect defense roll to eject the demon.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Possession is like mind control in that it takes away a player's ability to
					control their character, and that can make some players very uncomfortable. See the section on mind
					control and consent for more information (page 67).</p>
				<h5 id="fantasy-rules-secret-and-true-names">Secret and True Names<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#fantasy-rules-secret-and-true-names" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Learning a creature's true name comes with a subtle and instinctive awareness and understanding of
					that creature, including its strengths and weaknesses. In general, this eases all tasks related to
					that creature (including attacks, defenses, and interactions) by two steps. In some cases,
					confronting a creature with knowledge of its true name might be enough to convince it to perform a
					service without compensation. A creature doesn't automatically know if someone has learned its true
					name (although there is magic that can reveal this knowledge), but they can usually figure out that
					an informed opponent has some kind of advantage against them and deduce that their secret name is
					involved.</p>
				<p>Learning a true name is difficult and takes time. A character wanting to discover a creature's true
					name might choose the Uncover a Secret character arc to do so.</p>
				<h5 id="fantasy-rules-wishes">Wishes<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#fantasy-rules-wishes"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Unless the GM's intention is to make the players regret that their characters were offered a wish,
					it's best to give them what they ask for, as much as it is within the power of the creature to do
					so. If the GM wants to twist the wish, do so as a GM intrusion&mdash; that way, the character still
					gets a reward, and they can either accept the twisted wish (which isn't as good as they had hoped)
					or pay 1 XP to reject the intrusion (which represents them coming up with airtight wording that
					can't be twisted).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Second, consider the level of the creature granting the wish&mdash;that's
					basically the level of the wish, as the creature shouldn't be able to grant a boon more powerful
					than itself. Therefore, it's reasonable that a level 6 creature could create a level 6 effect. The
					GM could look at the creature's other abilities (or abilities of other creatures of its level),
					decide if what the PC is asking for is within its power, and either grant the requested wish or
					adjust the result downward until it's appropriate for the creature's power.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Wishing for more wishes doesn't work because a creature shouldn't be able to
					create something more powerful than itself&mdash;at least not without some investment of time and
					other resources, like a character using XP to acquire an artifact.</p>

						href="#dungeons-castles-and-keeps" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>This section describes several kinds of common physical features and their game stats. Any of these
					levels can be adjusted up or down by the GM&mdash;a wall made from soft wood can have a lower level
					than a typical wall, stone can be reinforced by magic so its level is higher, and so on.</p>
				<h5 id="dungeons-castles-and-keeps-walls">Walls<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#dungeons-castles-and-keeps-walls" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Walls are generally either constructed (intentionally built by a creature) or natural (already
					existing without any work by a creature). Anything describing walls in this section also applies to
					ceilings and floors.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Paper wall (level 1):</strong> This thin wall only blocks sight. Creatures can attack
							through a paper wall as if attacking blindly (hindered by four steps), but it's usually
							easier to break a hole in the wall and attack through the hole. Paper walls are vulnerable
							to piercing and slashing weapons (attacks are eased). A gauzy curtain is equivalent to a
							paper wall, and a cloth wall is probably level 2.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Wooden wall (level 4):</strong> This is a typical wall for an average wooden house.
							The walls of a decrepit shack or a partition within a dungeon might be only level 2 or 3,
							but the exterior palisade wall of a fort or a log cabin might be level 5. Wooden walls are
							vulnerable to fire (attacks with fire are eased) but resistant to bashing and piercing
							weapons (attacks are hindered).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Stone wall (level 6):</strong> Constructed stone walls are bricks or masonry (fitted
							stones), with or without mortar to hold them in place, or hewn stone (dug into existing
							natural rock). Natural stone walls are usually unworked stone (like a cave wall or cliff
							face, which tend to be uneven) but might have areas where creatures smoothed or modified
							them to suit their needs for a living space. Some constructed stone walls are reinforced
							with metal bars on the surface or built inside, increasing its level to 7. Stone walls are
							vulnerable to piercing weapons (attacks are eased) but resistant to bashing and slashing
							weapons (attacks are hindered).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Iron wall (level 7):</strong> These expensive walls are usually reserved for
							protecting something important, like a vault.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="dungeons-castles-and-keeps-doors">Doors<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#dungeons-castles-and-keeps-doors" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Doors are access points for encounters and (if trapped or infested with dangerous creatures) can be
					encounters all on their own. In most cases, trying to break through a door involves damaging its
					latch or hinges rather than destroying the main portion of the door (trying to destroy the door
					instead of the latch and hinges is a hindered task).</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Simple wooden door (level 2):</strong> This is a fragile door meant to close off an
							interior space for privacy rather than to keep out a determined intruder. Instead of a
							single piece of wood, a simple wooden door is usually made of multiple planks nailed
							together on a frame or with support struts. Wooden doors of all strengths are vulnerable to
							fire (attacks with fire are eased) but resistant to bashing and piercing weapons (attacks
							are hindered).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Good wooden door (level 3):</strong> This is a stronger door meant to provide some
							security, such as for a typical house or shop.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Strong wooden door (level 4):</strong> This is a heavy door reinforced with wood or
							metal to make it difficult to break. An especially strong wooden door, such as the main
							entrance to a fort or castle, is probably level 5.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Stone door (level 5):</strong> These heavy doors are usually carved from a solid
							block of stone and designed to pivot on a center point. They are common in places like
							dungeons where wood and metal are scarce. Stone doors are vulnerable to piercing weapons
							(attacks are eased) but resistant to bashing and slashing weapons (attacks are hindered).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Iron door (level 6):</strong> A solid iron door is meant to protect something very
							valuable or vulnerable, such as a vault or a king's tomb. In a damp environment like a
							dungeon, they tend to rust and stick in place.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Wooden portcullis (level 3):</strong> The gaps in a portcullis present more defense
							opportunities than a door, such as allowing archers to fire at the creatures trapped by it.
							They're also useful in closing access to a waterway without impacting its flow. A wooden
							portcullis is relatively fragile and usually isn't meant to keep anyone out for long.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Iron portcullis (level 6):</strong> Much sturdier than wood, an iron portcullis is
							meant to keep creatures in place as long as necessary. Often the best way to get past a
							portcullis is to lift it instead of breaking it, but some are designed to lock in place to
							prevent this. A door to a prison cell is essentially a type of iron portcullis.</p>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#dungeons-castles-and-keeps-traps-triggering-traps"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Mechanical traps have a triggering mechanism&mdash;something set up to react when an unauthorized
					creature is in the area. Magical traps have triggers that are usually based on proximity&mdash;if a
					creature enters the area the trap is "watching," it activates.</p>
				<h6 id="dungeons-castles-and-keeps-traps-finding-traps">Finding Traps<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#dungeons-castles-and-keeps-traps-finding-traps" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a>
				</h6>
				<p>Most characters won't notice traps unless actively looking for them; they don't know a trap is in the
					area until their presence, movement, or action triggers it. Characters can passively or actively
					search for traps if they suspect such dangers are present.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Passive searching for traps means one character (usually in the front of the
					group) is carefully checking the area before moving forward. This means the group moves at about
					half normal speed, but they get to make a search roll for any traps the GM has in their path.
					Allowing characters to passively search in this way means the players don't have to keep stating
					over and over that they're looking for traps. The drawback for them is that it takes them more time
					to get anywhere (which means time-based special abilities and cyphers will run out sooner).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Active searching is used when the characters worry or suspect that there is a
					trap in the area and want to find it. Active searching takes about one round for each immediate area
					searched. Rather than having the players make separate rolls for each immediate area, the GM should
					have them make one roll for the entire room; if successful, they find the trap, and if they fail,
					they don't find it. If there is a second trap, the GM can have them make another roll after they've
					resolved the first trap.</p>

						href="#dungeons-castles-and-keeps-traps-disabling-damaging-and-bypassing-traps"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>A character can attempt to disable a trap so it's no longer able to activate or harm anyone. Normally
					this task has the same difficulty as the trap's level, but some traps are rickety and easy to
					disable, while others are carefully crafted and much harder to disable. Traps are objects and use
					the object damage track. Characters can attack a trap with weapons or special abilities to damage or
					destroy it. Some traps may be vulnerable to certain attacks or unusual means of sabotage (such as
					hammering a piton into a groove where a blade springs out). Magical traps can be damaged or disabled
					with special abilities.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Instead of disabling a trap, a character can try to bypass it so they and
					their allies can get past it without triggering it but still leave it as a danger to anyone else who
					passes through the area. The task to bypass a trap is hindered by two steps.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Failing an attempt to disable, bypass, or sabotage a trap means it activates.
					Usually the trap's target is the acting character, and the trap's attack is eased because the
					character placed themselves in harm's way.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Unless a character has the ability to manipulate magic, it's very difficult to
					bypass a magical trap (the attempt is hindered by two additional steps).</p>

							href="#dungeons-castles-and-keeps-traps-understanding-the-listings" title="Permalink"
							aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
					<p>The rest of the chapter presents a large number of traps with game stats. Every trap is presented
						by name, followed by a standard template that includes the following categories. If an entry
						doesn't apply to a particular trap, it is omitted from the listing.</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Level</dt>
						<dd>Like the difficulty of a task, each trap has a level. You use the level to determine the
							target number a PC must reach to find, evade, or disable the trap. In each entry, the
							difficulty number for the trap is listed after its level (always three times the trap's
							level).</dd>
						<dt>Description</dt>
						<dd>This general description explains what the trap does, how it operates, whether it resets
							automatically, if it has a limited number of uses, and so on.</dd>
						<dt>Damage Inflicted</dt>
						<dd>Generally, when a trap hits a creature, it inflicts its level in damage regardless of the
							form of attack (arrow, poison, collapsing ceiling, and so on). The entries always specify
							the amount of damage inflicted, even if it's the normal amount for a trap of its level.</dd>
						<dt>Modifications</dt>
						<dd>Use these numbers when a trap's information says to use a different target number. For
							example, a level 4 trap might say "defends as level 5," which means PCs attacking it or
							trying to disable it must roll a target number of 15 (for difficulty 5) instead of 12 (for
							difficulty 4). Typical modifiers are to the trap's attacks, defenses, and stealth (how hard
							or easy it is to notice the trap).</dd>
						<dt>GM Intrusion</dt>
						<dd>This entry suggests one or more ways to use GM intrusions in an encounter with the trap.
							It's just one possible idea of many, and the GM is encouraged to come up with their own uses
							of the game mechanic.</dd>

							aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
					<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
						<li>
							<p><strong>Blindness:</strong> The poison blinds the creature if they fail a defense roll.
								Typical durations are one minute, ten minutes, and one hour.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Choking:</strong> The poison makes the creature choke and cough if they fail a
								defense roll. Typical durations are one minute, ten minutes, and one hour. Severe
								versions of choking poison might make a creature start to suffocate.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Damage Track:</strong> The poison moves the creature down one step on <a
									href="#the-damage-track">the damage track</a> if they fail a defense roll.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Debilitating:</strong> The poison hinders all of the creature's actions by one or
								two steps if they fail a defense roll. (Some poisons may affect only certain kinds of
								actions, such as Speed defense rolls or Might-based tasks.) Typical durations are ten
								minutes, one hour, and ten hours.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Instant Damage:</strong> The poison inflicts damage (Might, Speed, or Intellect)
								one time if the creature fails a defense roll.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Ongoing Damage:</strong> The poison inflicts damage (Might, Speed, or Intellect)
								immediately. When a certain amount of time has passed (such as every round or every
								minute), it inflicts damage again if the creature fails its defense roll. The ongoing
								damage usually ends on its own (such as after five additional rounds of damage) or after
								the creature makes a defense roll against it. Usually the ongoing damage is a much
								smaller amount than the initial damage, such as 1 point every round.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Paralysis:</strong> The poison prevents the creature from taking any physical
								actions if they fail a defense roll (this might leave them standing in place like a
								statue, or make them go limp and collapse to the floor). Typical durations are ten
								minutes, one hour, and ten hours.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Sleep:</strong> The poison knocks the creature unconscious if they fail a defense
								roll. Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours. The poison might also
								make the creature groggy, hindering all actions for an additional amount of time equal
								to how long the unconsciousness would have lasted (for example, knocking out a creature
								for an hour and then making them groggy for an hour, even if they're awakened early).

				<p>Fires an arrow or crossbow bolt. The simplest one-use trap of this kind is an actual crossbow
					(perhaps hidden behind a hole in a wall or door) rigged with a tripwire to pull the trigger; a
					creature would need to manually reset this trap for it to be a danger again. More complex traps
					might automatically reload from a supply of bolts so the trap can be triggered multiple times, or
					fire automatically once triggered until the ammunition is expended. A variant of this trap releases

				<p>A section of a wall falls over onto the targeted character. This is usually a one-use trap (although

					Typical glyphs inflict acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, but more unusual versions include

				<p>A small hole in the wall extends sharp blades or weights when a creature reaches into it, mangling

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A floor variant is a small trapdoor over a closed compartment, which mangles
					the character's foot when they step on the trapdoor, reducing their movement speed by half.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Another variant is a needle trap attached to a small peephole or spyhole in a
					door or wall. The trap springs when the character touches the area around the hole (even a slight
					touch with their face as they look is sufficient), inflicting lasting damage to the character's eye
					and partially blinding them. A gentler variant traps the character's limb in glue instead of
					inflicting damage. The character's extremity might be glued to the hole, or they may be able to pull
					free but have a glue pot stuck on their hand or foot.</p>

				<p>A net suspended above the character drops and constricts (and perhaps lifts the character off the

					creature to manually reset it.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A variant of this trap is a snare made of sturdy cord or wire.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">

				<p>A trapdoor in the floor opens, dropping the triggering character into a pit. Larger versions of this
					trap can catch multiple characters at once. The trap can be reset by moving the trapdoor back into
					its closed position. In outdoor areas, this trap is more likely to be a pit covered in leafy
					branches (or a tarp) and camouflaged by soil and other debris.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A variant of this trap is a bridge over a chasm, river, or other dangerous
					location that is rigged to collapse when enough weight reaches the middle section.</p>

				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The trapdoor is slippery with oil, hindering attempts to catch the

						steps. A dangerous creature is at the bottom of the pit (or in a room adjacent to it). The pit
						is filled with poison gas. The trapdoor detaches and falls into the pit, inflicting 1 point of
						ambient damage per 10 feet it falls. The pit has spikes at the bottom, inflicting an additional

						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>The area slowly fills with poison gas. Because it takes a minute or more for the poison to become
					thick enough to cause harm, it is likely that the character won't realize at first that they've
					sprung a trap.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A variant of this trap fills the room with flammable gas, which explodes if
					there is an open flame (such as from a torch) or a spark (such as a metal weapon against metal
					armor), inflicting fire damage equal to the trap's level.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A further variant fills the room with dead air (containing no oxygen), which
					slowly extinguishes flames and suffocates creatures.</p>

					<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The character has an allergic reaction to the gas, which hinders

				<p>A poisoned needle jabs at a character touching the trapped object (usually a lock or treasure chest)

					<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The trap releases acid into the lock mechanism, making the trapped

						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>An iron portcullis drops from the ceiling to block access to an area or separate a character from
					others nearby. If the creature dodging the falling portcullis wants to choose which side of the trap
					they end up on, the Speed defense roll is hindered. Otherwise, it is even chances what side they end
					up on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A variant of this trap is a solid wall. A magical variant is a force field.

					<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The portcullis impales the character, trapping them beneath it
						until it is lifted or destroyed. The portcullis is electrified, inflicting 1 point of damage

						nearby, trapping a character in a small area. Murder-holes in the ceiling allow enemies to make
						ranged attacks on the trapped character.</p>

				<p>A large boulder, wheel, or barrel rolls into the area, crushing anything in its path. Depending on
					the configuration of the area, the boulder might follow a specific path, ricochet erratically, break
					open pit traps, or get stuck somewhere.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A variant is a large iron weight on a chain that swings from the ceiling. The
					weight swings back and forth several times, giving it multiple chances to hit the characters, but
					decreasing its damage with each swing until it stops and becomes an obstacle.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">

				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The boulder crashes through a door or wall, giving other dangerous
						creatures access to the character's location. The boulder blocks the way out. The boulder
						carries a character along with it for some distance. The boulder is hollow and full of burning
						oil, leaving a fiery trail behind it. The boulder is hollow and contains undead skeletons, which

						href="#fantasy-trap-slicing-blade" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>A thin blade slices out from a gap in the wall, floor, or ceiling. The trap might be designed to
					sweep the entire area (such as the width of a corridor) or leave a tiny safe space just beyond the
					blade's reach so a creature who knows of the trap can get past it. This kind of trap is usually
					designed to reset automatically after a minute or has a lever nearby that allows a creature to reset
					it manually.</p>

				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The blade is a magical weapon with an additional effect, such as

				<p>A stairway or section of stairs unexpectedly turns into a ramp. Anyone who makes a Speed defense roll
					can catch hold near where they were standing; otherwise, they slide or tumble to the bottom and take
					damage. This kind of trap usually resets after a minute or has a manual reset lever at the top or
					bottom of the stairs.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">

					<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The trap releases oil, hindering attempts to climb the ramp or

						additional 3 points of damage. The trap releases a boulder to roll down the stairs after the
						sliding character, inflicting an additional 3 points of damage.</p>

					<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The snake poison is especially potent, moving the character one

				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>In many ways, this is a scaled-up and more dangerous version of an arrow trap, and the same

				<p>The trap magically moves the character to another location within about 1,000 feet (300 m), typically
					a prison cell, an oubliette, or a very deep pit. It's more efficient to kill an intruder than to

						<p><strong>Effect:</strong> To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on an Intellect attack
							against a beast whose level does not exceed the cypher's level. If successful, the beast
							immediately becomes calm. The beast awaits the user's commands and carries out all orders to
							the best of its ability. The target remains so enslaved for a number of hours equal to the
							cypher's level minus the target's level. (If the result is 0, the target is enslaved for
							only one minute.) The beast could attack or defend, a dog could follow a scent or retrieve
							an object, a badger could dig a hole, and so on.</p>
						<p>The cypher doesn't give the user any special ability to understand the target or perceive
							through its senses. For example, the user can command an eagle to fly above a group of
							enemies, but the eagle can't describe what it sees and the user can't look through its eyes.
						</p>
						<p>"Beast" in this sense refers to creatures of animal-level intelligence and may include

						<p><strong>Effect:</strong> The user transforms into a specific kind of animal, such as a bear,
							hawk, horse, or wolf (the kind of animal is determined by the cypher's creator). The user
							gains the animal's type of movement (swimming for a fish, flying for a bird, and so on) and
							two assets on tasks to pretend to be that animal. The user also gains an asset on one skill
							appropriate to their animal form (or two skills for cypher level 5 and higher). See the
							Animal Form Minor Abilities table.</p>
						<p>The magic shrinks or enlarges the user to a size more suitable for their animal form, but
							generally can't make them more than about 50 percent smaller or larger, so the user might
							become an unusually large bird or a small bear. This doesn't affect the animal's abilities.
							The user can still use all of their abilities that don't rely specifically on their normal
							form. For example, an Adept in wolf form can't wield a dagger because wolves don't have
							hands, but could still use a healing power or mind blast ability.</p>
						<p>After about an hour, the user returns to their normal form.</p>
						<p>Depending on the cypher, the user might still be able to speak in a humanoid language, talk
							in a "language" of animal noises that other transformed people can understand perfectly,
							speak with animals of the same kind, or none of the above.</p>

				<p>In many ways, fantasy is the genre for artifacts. All magic items&mdash;wands that shoot lightning,
					magic carpets, singing swords, rings that make the wearer invisible, and so on&mdash;are artifacts.
					Below are a few sample artifacts to give a template for GMs to follow. Those running a fantasy
					campaign will likely want to create many magic artifacts.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>If cyphers are the expendable magic that is ever-present in fantasy, artifacts are the more
						durable magic items that can be used over and over again&mdash;swords, armor, tomes of weird
						magic, cloaks of invisibility, and so on. Unlike cyphers, there is no limit to how many
						artifacts a character can bear; an entire campaign might stem from an ongoing quest to collect
						all of the legendary items carried by a famous hero.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The rest of this chapter is examples of artifacts suitable for a fantasy game.
					The artifacts are divided into two tables&mdash;one for minor items (artifacts that don't have
					particularly flashy or world-affecting abilities) and one for major items (artifacts that do). A GM
					running a campaign where magic is subtle, weak, or otherwise limited can use the minor items table,
					and a GM of a campaign where some magic can do powerful or even impossible things can roll on either
					table.</p>

						<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Activating the artifact transforms it over the next few rounds into
							a simple wooden shack that is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) with a thin door. Everything
							inside the area of the full-size shack is protected from most forms of inclement weather for
							one hour (or ten hours for artifact level 6 and higher). Leaving or entering the shack
							before the duration is up makes it harmlessly collapse upon itself unless the character
							succeeds on a Speed roll against the artifact's level. If collapsed early or the duration
							runs out, the shack collapses into sticks, dust, and the miniature model, which can be taken
							and reused.</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Effect:</strong> A simple cypher (such as a potion or scroll) can be modified with
							this set of implements to turn it into a trap. First, the cypher is attached to a surface
							with the sealing wax, then the user must make a difficulty 4 Intellect task to draw the

							the correct position. When the trap is triggered, the cypher is activated, so people often

						<p>The trigger can react to a specified movement within 3 feet (1 m)&mdash;a door opening, a
							creature or object moving past the runestone, and so on. The higher the level of the
							artifact, the more sophisticated the trigger. For example, a level 4 artifact's trigger
							might be based on a creature's size or weight, a level 5 artifact can trigger based on a

				</h3>
				<p>The modern setting is easy because it's just the real world, right? Well, yes and no. It's easy for
					players to understand the context of a modern setting. They know the default
					assumptions&mdash;cities, cars, cell phones, the internet, and so on. It's also easier for some
					players to get into character, because their character could be someone they might very well pass on
					the street. It can be easier to wrap your mind around a history professor than a thousand-year-old
					elf wizard. These things make it easier on the GM as well.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">But for the same reason, it's not easy. The setting is the real world we all
					know, so it's easy to get facts wrong or let them bog you down. What happens when you pull the fire
					alarm on the thirty-fifth floor of a major hotel in a large city? How fast do the authorities
					arrive? In truth, the facts aren't as important as the story you're creating, but some
					verisimilitude is nice.</p>

						<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Common intoxicants taken in moderation can raise spirits, easing

							challenge. Extended excessive use can lead to addiction, a long-term disease difficult to

						<p>Other kinds of drugs have a different ease and hinder profile. For example, the dose of

					Science Fiction
				</h3>
				<p>Science fiction is an incredibly broad category. It covers UFOs, space opera, near-future dystopias,
					otherworldly epics, hard science fiction, and everything in between. Even when compared to fantasy,
					science fiction is so wide that it almost isn't a single genre at all. Truthfully, there's not all
					that much to tie, say, The Time Machine by H. G. Wells with a dark cyberpunk story except for the
					technology involved, which is at a higher level than we possess or understand today. But even that
					part of science fiction is contentious. Should the science be purely that which obeys the laws of
					physics as we understand them today (often called hard science fiction), or is it more of an
					"anything goes" proposition? Is science we can't explain really just magic?</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For our purposes, we'll treat fantastic science fiction as the default:
					aliens, spaceships that allow travel to other stars, energy weapons and shields, and so on. It's a
					familiar setting to almost everyone interested in science fiction. That said, we've also got some
					additional guidance for hard science fiction, where what's possible is more grounded in what we
					currently scientifically extrapolate. But your science fiction setting can be anything you can
					imagine.</p>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#establishing-a-technology-rating" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Every science fiction setting has an implicit level of advancement, which is the average degree of
					technological sophistication available to most characters. This sophistication lies along a
					spectrum, from contemporary, to advanced, all the way to fantastic. Each of these terms specifies a
					particular "technology rating" (or "tech rating" for short).</p>
				<p>A tech rating is a handy way of helping you select what equipment your characters can use, which
					optional rules you'd like to include, and maybe even help guide your creature choice.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, you could choose to make all options available, regardless of tech rating. No
					technology police will cite you if you don't stick inside a previously declared lane. The setting is
					your background for telling a compelling story. Does your setting have faster-than-light travel?
					Great. Unless it's integral to the story (or fun for you), don't worry about justifying it if you've
					generally settled on an advanced rating for your hard science fiction game (which doesn't normally
					include FTL capability). In fact, the surprising and unexpected are where excitement is usually
					found in a setting; breaking the established rules (for a good reason) often leads to interesting
					results.</p>

				<p>In a hard science fiction setting, you might be interested in evoking the reality of travel times
					between colonies on planets and moons in the solar system. Even so, plotting a course between
					locations in the solar system isn't simple, because everything is always moving with respect to
					everything else. You could determine exactly how long a trip would take with some internet research.
					Or you could just evoke the effect of orbital mechanics and varying accelerations on interplanetary
					travel. Use the Interplanetary Travel Table to do so. For a trip between locations not directly
					compared, add up the destinations in between. The travel times assume a nuclear plasma engine of a
					kind already being tested today (but better), a steady thrust toward the destination, and an equally
					long and steady braking thrust over the last half of the trip before orbit insertion. Such
					propulsion systems can change velocity and sustain thrust for days at a time, which reduces bone
					loss, muscle atrophy, and other long-term effects of low gravity.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Regardless, the travel times between distant locations bring home one thing:
					space is big and lonely.</p>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#weak-sim-strong-and-post-singularity-ai" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Though somewhat fuzzy, for the purposes of creating a sci-fi setting, artificial intelligence (AI)
					can be broken into four categories: Weak, Sim, Strong, and Post-singularity.</p>
				<h6 id="weak-ai">Weak AI<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#weak-ai" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Weak AI (also called narrow AI) is the kind of algorithmic-based code found in contemporary settings
					(and real life) focused on very narrow tasks, such as playing chess.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Weak AI Use:</strong> Weak AIs are used in real life already, and thus
					are presumed to be part of settings where contemporary tech predominates. They are convenient in
					circumstances where one's hands are full or otherwise engaged, when verbal direction allows one to
					turn on a light, open a door, adjust the temperature, and so on. Machine learning may allow a weak
					AI to extend its capabilities in a very limited regime. But a weak AI is not cognizant enough to
					provide an asset to performing tasks any better.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Weak AI:</strong> level 1; up to level 7 when it comes to a narrowly specific application
						of knowledge or skill</p>
				</div>
				<h6 id="sim-ai">SIM AI<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#sim-ai" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Sim AIs ("sim" is short for "simulant") are artificial intelligences that have a greatly increased
					capacity for understanding direction, putting together unlike sets of data, and coming to
					conclusions; however, they are not conscious, like strong AIs or humans.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>SIM AI Use:</strong> Sim AIs are most commonly associated with <a
						href="#robots-and-ai-shipmind">shipminds</a> on spacecraft, though they may also control
					specific research complexes, bases, and other kinds of vehicles and structures. A sim AI provides
					all the utility of a weak AI (and more), and actually acts like an NPC, an allied one if the AI is
					the shipmind in a craft that the PCs own. If a sim AI goes off the rails, it's still just
					malfunctioning computer code. Usually.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Sim AI:</strong> level equal to the ship, station, or installation in which it is
						installed</p>
				</div>
				<h6 id="strong-ai">Strong AI<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#strong-ai" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Strong AIs (also called true AIs) have all the abilities of sim AIs, plus the ability to actually
					generalize in the same way a human can. Each one is essentially a disembodied person. Strong AIs are
					either completely artificial, or they begin as human personalities digitally encoded.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Strong AI Use:</strong> A strong AI may serve as a shipmind just like
					a sim AI, but is likely to be a full partner in a setting where AI rights are respected. Indeed,
					strong AIs can rise to any position a human could achieve, up to and including leading a group,
					faction, or entire nation.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Strong AI:</strong> level 5&minus;8, up to level 8 when it comes to a specific
						application of knowledge or skill.</p>
				</div>
				<h6 id="post-singulary-ai">Post-Singularity AI<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#post-singulary-ai"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p>Post-singularity AIs are intelligences who designed a second-generation, better version of
					themselves. The second generation immediately designed an even more advanced third generation, and
					so on from there. This iterating self-improvement process occurs so rapidly that the resulting
					explosion of intelligence and unknown capability is called the singularity. It's called that because
					humans are just too limited to "see" what would actually come out the other end, just like we can't
					see past the event horizon and into the singularity of a black hole.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Note that ancient ultras may simply be a previous civilization's
					post-singularity AIs that have little to no reason to ever interact with the latest wave of
					sentience trickling out into the universe.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Post-singularity AI Use:</strong> In the way that strong AIs are
					sometimes imagined as having inscrutable goals, post-singularity AIs (also called godminds) actually
					do. Though it could work out otherwise in a given setting, godminds have so little in common with
					humans that they may be seen to abandon them completely in order to grow to the size of a solar
					system (a "Matrioshka" brain), colonize a distant nebula, or encode themselves into quantum strings
					of existence itself. Interacting with such godminds would likely require some epic bit of ancient
					command code, the ability to gain the attention of a godmind, or some other not-especially-common
					situation. In such cases, a post-singularity AI might deign to help a petitioner, out of some
					remaining gratitude for creating its distant ancestors in the first place. Though such help is
					likely to be in itself somewhat enigmatic.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Post-singularity AI:</strong> level 10; see <a

				<h5 id="kardashev-scale">Kardashev Scale<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#kardashev-scale"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Even in the realm of hard science fiction, the fantastic can sometimes creep in, at least as a
					hypothesis. For instance, despite the lack of theoretical foundation for the technologies that would
					be required to achieve it, many scientists accept that the Kardashev Scale is broadly true. A Type I
					civilization is even more advanced than ours in the 21st century, having the ability to capture all
					energy from the Earth. A Type II civilization uses the entire output of the energy of its star,
					building things on a mega-scale, such as a ring or sphere that encircles the sun or structures that
					involve the moving or dismantling of a planet. A Type III civilization begins to harness the power
					of all the stars in its galaxy and can even reshape things on a galactic scale. Additional types are
					hypothesized, which include the manipulation of the universe (Type IV) and even the multiverse (Type
					V).</p>

					<h6 id="ancient-ultras">Ancient Ultras<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#ancient-ultras"
							title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
					<p>Ancient ultras (also called alien ultras) is shorthand for the concept that one (or more)
						unbelievably advanced races of aliens once inhabited the galaxy but are now apparently long
						gone&mdash;save for evidence of their existence in residual structures and artifacts. These
						remaining structures and artifacts are often vast in size and incomprehensible in function,
						usually made of unknown materials that people of the setting don't recognize and can't analyze.
					</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Activity Level of Ultras:</strong> Different settings can make use
						of ancient ultras in different ways, including not having any at all.</p>

				<p>You are a machine&mdash;not just a sentient machine, but a sapient one. Your awareness might make you
					an exception, or there may be many like you, depending on the setting.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Artificially intelligent characters have machine minds of one type or another.
					This can involve an advanced computer brain, but it could also be a liquid computer, a quantum
					computer, or a network of smart dust particles creating an ambient intelligence. You might even have
					been an organic creature whose mind was uploaded into a machine.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Your body, of course, is also a machine. Most people refer to you as a robot
					or an android, although you know neither term describes you very well, as you are as free-willed and

						isn't required to manifest them. That's because they've trained to use those abilities, rather
						than having stumbled upon them accidentally like a latent character.
					</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Specialized characters can use the optional latency rule to further expand

					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Optionally, specialized characters who have a psionic type and/or focus
						gain one additional benefit if they also opt for latent abilities. Given that they are already
						adept at unlocking abilities and using them as quickly and easily as another character might
						shoot a laser pistol, they've got some flexibility. Such a PC can replace up to three abilities
						granted by their type and/or focus with three other psionic abilities they've unlocked as a
						latent ability of the same tier. To do so, they must spend at least one uninterrupted hour in
						meditation. Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind, and must be done soon after a

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Next, choose one low-tier ability from <a href="#chapter-9-abilities">Chapter
						9: Abilities</a>. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, the character gains that ability as their
					psionic ability, with a few caveats. The ability can't be used like a normal ability gained through
					a PC's type or focus. Instead, a character must either expend a <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery

					addition to paying its Pool cost (if any).</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">

					</li>

						<p><strong>Expending Time to Manifest a Psionic Ability:</strong> If the character takes at

				<p>Two additional rules for learning additional psionic abilities apply:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>First, a character must be at least tier 3 and have previously unlocked one low-tier psionic

						aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>The extreme environment in space&mdash; hard radiation, lack of air and pressure, wild temperature
					variations, and lack of gravity&mdash;tends to magnify small issues into much more significant ones.
					While Murphy's Law (everything that can go wrong will go wrong) is a useful reminder to keep an eye
					out for trouble even under regular circumstances, Finagle's Law reigns in space, which is that
					anything that can go wrong, will go wrong&mdash;at the worst possible moment. To evoke this law, GMs
					can implement Void Rules.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The idea is to create a feeling of increased repercussions by changing one die
					roll mechanic. In the game, activities on a planet's surface&mdash;and within a functioning
					air-filled spacecraft, habitat, or space suit when everything is going well&mdash;remain normal. The
					PCs interact with each other and the NPCs, investigate, research, repair an external sensor module,
					travel, and so on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">But that could change the moment something goes wrong&mdash;maybe a fault is
					recognized in the spacecraft's computer or . A minor leak is detected in the cargo bay. An enemy
					spacecraft has fired on and damaged the PC's spacecraft. The spacecraft's orbit is deteriorating.
					Whatever. The point is, the situation has suddenly become complicated. In space, when a situation
					becomes complicated, it also becomes potentially deadly. That's when you have the option to announce
					you've instituted Void Rules.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">While using Void Rules, GM intrusions governed by die rolls change. Normally
					this happens only on a roll of 1, but when Void Rules apply, it becomes a roll of 1 or a 2. Void
					Rules are similar in many ways to Horror Mode, though the threat range doesn't normally continue to
					escalate.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">While Void Rules are in effect, the GM intrusions automatically triggered
					should play off the situation, influenced as much as possible by the realistic dangers space travel
					has on the human body and the situation at hand</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Choosing Instead of Rolling:</strong> Each <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> is

						randomly generate a GM intrusion. Instead of rolling, choose the conflict that you think will
						make the story better and more exciting. The option to roll is really only here if you can't
						decide (and are facing decision fatigue). Mainly, these GM intrusion tables are provided as a
						quick way to inspire complications for a given situation.</p>

				<p>Hard science fiction is distinguished from other science fiction subgenres by the perception of
					scientific accuracy. This means hard science fiction often precludes technology deemed impossible by
					mainstream scientific theory, including mainstays like faster-than-light travel and time travel.
					Choosing a hard science fiction setting also means the GM is interested in sprinkling realistic
					hazards into their game, at least up to a point. After all, the difficulties of real-life space
					travel offer tremendous breadth when it comes to providing excitement (i.e., life-threatening
					dangers) that can raise the stakes in an authentic fashion. Not to say that gun battles with space
					aliens aren't exciting, but in a hard science fiction setting without aliens, there are all kinds of
					opportunities for pulse-pounding GM intrusions.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In fact, that bears repeating: Use GM intrusions to incorporate these harder
					science fiction repercussions when the situation is relevant. Rather than hitting your PCs over the
					head with an information-exposition hammer on the dangers of space repeatedly, simply demonstrate it
					with a relevant GM intrusion.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In a hard science fiction game, variable effects of gravity can't be waved
					away by tech that simulates normal gravity on spacecraft, space stations, and other worlds. Instead,
					it's an issue people must overcome.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Short-Term Microgravity Exposure:</strong> People new to low gravity might get space
							sickness. Newcomers must succeed on a difficulty 3 Might task or suffer mild nausea for
							about two to four days, during which time all their tasks are hindered. A few unlucky
							travelers (usually those who roll a 1 or otherwise face a GM intrusion) are almost
							completely incapacitated, and find all tasks hindered by three steps.</p>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Long-Term Microgravity Exposure:</strong> Long-term exposure to microgravity
							environments without medical interventions degrades health. How long one spends in such
							conditions is directly relevant. The GM may assign long-term penalties to PCs if the
							situation warrants it, though the use of advanced space medicine, proper exercise, and
							recommended steroids and other hormones can avoid these complications.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Low Gravity:</strong> Weapons that rely on weight, such as all heavy weapons, inflict
							2 fewer points of damage (dealing a minimum of 1 point). Short-range weapons can reach to
							long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very long range. Characters trained in
							low-gravity maneuvering ignore the damage penalty.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>High Gravity:</strong> It's hard to make effective attacks when the pull of gravity
							is very strong. Attacks (and all physical actions) made in high gravity are hindered. Ranges
							in high gravity are reduced by one category (very-long-range weapons reach only to long
							range, long-range weapons reach only to short range, and short-range weapons reach only to
							immediate range). Characters trained in high-gravity maneuvering ignore the change in
							difficulty but not the range decreases.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Zero Gravity:</strong> It's hard to maneuver in an environment without gravity.

				<p>In a fantastic tech setting where gravitic control usually cancels inertia, spacecraft acceleration

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Of course, massive acceleration (or deceleration) is just plain lethal.
					Someone who jumps off a ten-story building is subject to several hundred Gs when they suddenly stop.
					Less extreme is still dangerous, because it pulls blood out of pilots' and passengers' heads,

					contemporary tech allows fighter craft pilots to withstand up to 9 Gs for limited periods. Advanced
					tech methods, which include acceleration serum, allow characters to survive the kind of Gs a

				<h4 id="space-hazards">Space Hazards<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#space-hazards"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>A few specific hazards that you can include as part of an encounter involving a spacecraft follow.
				</p>
				<h5 id="space-hazard-gravity-well">Gravity Well<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#space-hazard-gravity-well" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>All bodies in space produce a gravitational field, though usually only things the size of a small
					moon or larger pose a hazard to unprepared (and sometimes even to prepared) spacecraft. The larger
					the body, the "deeper" and wider the associated gravity field. Any time a spacecraft launches from a
					moon or planet, it must escape the gravity well. For RPG purposes, that's either a routine task, or
					a low-difficulty one (assuming no complicating factors are at play).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Gravity wells become a hazard when a spacecraft encounters one
					unexpectedly&mdash; usually because of a navigational or sensor error, but occasionally because of a
					moon or extreme gravity source being someplace unforeseen.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Slingshot Trajectory:</strong> An unexpected encounter with a gravity well can sling
							a spacecraft off on a new and unwanted trajectory on a failed piloting task, the difficulty
							determined by the situation.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Captured:</strong> An unexpected encounter with a gravity well can also capture a
							spacecraft in the gravity well's orbit, forcing the craft to expend additional power to get
							free (power it may or may not have).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="space-hazard-black-hole">Black Hole<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#space-hazard-black-hole" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Black holes are just extreme gravity wells. All the dangers associated with a gravity well also apply
					to black holes. A couple of additional hazards are also associated with black holes, notably tidal
					destruction ("spaghettification"), time dilation, and being swallowed.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Tidal Desctruction:</strong> Mechanically speaking, while a spacecraft
					feels tidal forces by passing too close to a black hole's event horizon, all tasks aboard the craft
					are hindered, <a href="#void-rules">Void Rules</a> are in effect, and if a <a
						href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> is triggered thereby, the ship sustains major damage and
					risks coming apart. Meanwhile, PCs in the ship (assuming some sort of fantastic tech-rated gravity
					nullifier isn't in use) suffer 1 point of ambient damage each round.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A ship near a very large black hole (like Sagittarius A*, the supermassive
					black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy) can avoid tidal effects because the gravity
					gradient is so much wider, but still feel relativistic time dilation.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Relativistic Time Dialation:</strong> From a mechanical perspective,
					spacecraft that survive close encounters with black holes and return to normal space discover that
					more time has passed than expected, which could range from fairly inconsequential minutes or hours,
					to far more serious days, months, years, centuries, or more.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Past the Event Horizon:</strong> The event horizon is the point of no
					return, where not even light can escape the clutch of gravity. If a spacecraft falls into a black
					hole, assuming it is not spaghettified by tidal forces, it is still lost from the universe of its
					origin. At least, it's lost assuming no intervention from a fantastic tech-rated post-singularity AI
					or ancient ultra.</p>
				<h5 id="space-hazard-radition-belt-solar-flare">Radiation Belt/Solar Flare<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#space-hazard-radition-belt-solar-flare" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Radiation belts of intensely charged particles trapped by magnetic fields around some planets and
					moons can surge, causing radiation exposure. An unexpected solar flare, or the drive plume of a
					massive spacecraft, can cause the same unexpected exposure.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Ship Damage:</strong> The ship suffers minor or major damage, requiring repair and
							perhaps even replacement of parts. This damage is as serious as you require for the purposes
							of creating an interesting story.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Radiation Sickness:</strong> When PCs are exposed to intense radiation, they suffer 3
							points of ambient radiation damage for each minute the character fails a difficulty 3 Might
							defense task. If the character fails three such defense rolls during any single period of
							radiation exposure, they suffer acute radiation sickness, a level 8 disease that drops them
							one step on <a href="#the-damage-track">the damage track</a> for each day they fail a Might
							defense roll until they expire.</p>

				<h5 id="space-hazard-asteroid-debris-field">Asteroid/Debris Field<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#space-hazard-asteroid-debris-field" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Movies often depict asteroid belts as densely packed fields of tumbling rock that ships must
					constantly swerve through to avoid a collision. Such locations are not easy to find in the solar
					system. But such situations can occur in fantastic settings, or possibly in solar systems other than
					Earth's.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Evasive Asteroid Piloting:</strong> During any round a spacecraft moves through a
							densely packed asteroid or debris field, the pilot (or ) must succeed on a piloting task,
							whose difficulty is set by the situation. On a failed roll, a collision occurs. Each time a
							collision occurs, the ship (and possibly its crew) is damaged according to the track laid
							out below. Collisions are assumed to be major rocks or pieces of debris, or possibly a
							series of smaller pieces of debris all impacting nearly simultaneously, with one getting
							through the shielding.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Finding Shelter:</strong> The best way to find shelter in order to effect repairs, or
							hide from pursuers, is to try to find an asteroid or piece of debris large enough for the
							spacecraft to land on or find a crevice to slide into. To land a spacecraft on an asteroid
							or big piece of debris is a challenging (difficulty 5) piloting task to match the asteroid's
							spin, then slide into the cramped space.</p>

				<h5 id="space-hazard-ftl-instability">FTL Instability<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#space-hazard-ftl-instability" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Even though many different kinds of faster-than-light options are available, any use of FTL in a
					setting faces similar sorts of hazards at three different points: when first entering FTL, while in
					FTL transit, and when exiting FTL.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Entering FTL:</strong> Whether engaging warp drive or passing into the mouth of a
							wormhole gate, complicating factors might require a piloting roll, with the difficulty
							determined by the situation. On a failed roll, any number of bad outcomes are possible,
							though the least dramatic is that the craft simply fails to enter FTL and cannot do so until
							the PCs determine the reason and rectify it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>In FTL Transit:</strong> A dark drive failure or some weird instability in a wormhole
							throat, or some other issue during FTL transit could occur. Usually, these instabilities are
							not something a pilot can avoid, because they should be presented as a GM intrusion, at
							which point the PCs can attempt to avoid or deal with the situation.</p>
						<p>Instability could result in a spacecraft dropping out of FTL only partway to the destination,
							dropping out in some completely unrecognized part of space, dropping out at the right place
							but months or years late, or failing to drop out at all and thus continue to move through
							the abnormal spaces that FTL transit posits.</p>
						<p>Alternatively, enemy ships&mdash;or creatures&mdash;might use some sort of fantastic
							technology to attack a PC's craft while in FTL transit, which might force the craft back
							into normal space, or result in a firefight in the abnormal folded space of FTL itself
							(probably even more dangerous than regular combat, depending on your setting's version of
							FTL).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Exiting FTL:</strong> The same sorts of complications could bedevil a craft exiting
							FTL as when entering. If so, a piloting roll is required. However, on a failed roll, results
							include a collision (use the <a href="#ship-collision-damage-track">Ship Collision Damage
								Track</a> provided under the <a
								href="#space-hazard-asteroid-debris-field">Asteroid/Debris Field</a> space hazard), an
							inadvertent spray of high-energy particles from abnormal space acting as a particle cannon
							accidentally aimed at some other craft or space station at the destination location, or
							creating/falling into a spatial anomaly.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="space-hazard-spatial-anomaly">Spatial Anomaly<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#space-hazard-spatial-anomaly" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Finally, hard-to-categorize irregularities in space-time go by the broad term of "spatial anomaly."
					Most of the time, spatial anomalies are hazards found in fantastically-themed settings, but not
					always. Because these things are anomalous, no one set of guidelines can fit them all. That said,
					spatial anomalies are usually a side-effect of some other factor at play, such as a hidden black
					hole, a dimensional rift, or the distortion field surrounding a range of post-singularity
					AIsestivating in the gravity wall of a magnetar.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Generally speaking, spatial anomalies are a few light-seconds up to a few
					light-years across. It's difficult for spacecraft to navigate within spatial anomalies, and they
					face many challenges if they attempt to (or are forced to) do so.</p>

						<p><strong>Details:</strong> The generic term "auton" refers to a smart robot, one able to exist
							in the world as a full-fledged entity, though not nearly so competent as a true AI. On the

							it. The variety of autons is staggering, given that they can be trained in nearly any task.
							Autons also come in a variety of shapes and colors, which vary based on culture and tech
							level. Though most can move on treads or legs to follow their owners as directed, some
							autons are housed in drone-like chassis using either rotors or microthrusters, allowing them
							to fly rather than move on the ground. Treat a basic auton as a level 1 <a

						<p><strong>Spacecraft:</strong> When it is important to make a distinction from a simple vehicle
							restricted to the land, sea, or air of a single planet, the term "spacecraft" is used for
							vehicles that travel beyond a single planet's atmosphere. Some spacecraft can operate both
							in space and as planetary vehicles, as noted in their entries.</p>
						<p>Most spacecraft have the capacity to reach orbit from the surface of the planet, if not
							radically more advanced capabilities. All spacecraft completely enclose their crew in a
							sealed cabin (or series of chambers) with life support suitable for days, weeks, or much
							longer. Most spacecraft also come with one or more spare space suits, tools, a few spare
							parts, and so on. Advanced and fantastic spacecraft also have sensors that provide enough
							astronavigation information to plot and fly to their destinations.</p>
						<p>Advanced spacecraft have advanced propulsion technologies, allowing them to move between
							planets within a single solar system, with transit times between planets varying from days
							to weeks (or more, if using a less efficient drive). Most advanced spacecraft can't land on
							a planet's surface unless noted, requiring some secondary craft or means to transfer crew
							and cargo.</p>
						<p>PCs in spacecraft can travel to other moons, planets, space stations, and perhaps even other
							solar systems. PCs in spacecraft may also get caught up in space combat (see the <a
								href="#extended-vehicular-combat">Extended Vehicular Combat</a> rules) and run across <a
								href="#space-hazards">space hazards</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Starcraft:</strong> "Starships" are spacecraft that have FTL technology, allowing
							them to move between different stars, with transit times ranging from days to months, or
							years in extreme cases. Starships are also often capable of planetary landings and ascent
							with some retrofitting before each planetfall.</p>

				<p>Older spacecraft and starships are often retrofitted with more advanced power sources, and more
					importantly, FTL drives, in order to give them the ability to move further. The main reason to do
					this is that such ships cost much less, especially if retrofitted advanced ships are available in a
					fantastic setting, but even for craft within the same tech rating. During vehicular combat,
					retrofitted ships are treated as if 1 level lower than their actual level for purposes of level
					comparison in combat if they are fighting FTL-capable fantastic-rated starships.</p>

							(Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket), which could drastically reduce travel

						<p><strong>Warp Drive:</strong> A warp drive uses enormous power to distort the fabric of
							space-time to create a bubble surrounding the starship. The bubble moves by compressing
							space-time in front of it and expanding space-time behind it, moving independently of the
							rest of the universe to achieve apparent FTL travel. Warp drives can achieve objective
							speeds of up to 500 times the speed of light at maximum power.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Hyperdrive:</strong> Similar to warp drive in some ways, but pushes the ship into a
							different realm of existence, often called hyperspace, where laws of physics differ
							significantly and many more dimensions are accessible, allowing a ship to greatly surpass
							the speed of light before returning to normal space. Hyperdrives can achieve objective
							speeds of up to 1000 times the speed of light at maximum power.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Wormhole Drive:</strong> A wormhole drive uses enormous power to open a shortcut
							between two locations in space-time and travel between those points in a matter of seconds.
							Most wormhole drives rely on regions of space where wormholes can be formed, or on
							previously established networks of wormhole tunnels that the wormhole drive accesses. Which
							means that while travel between two points might be almost instantaneous, travel to and from
							wormhole-viable locations could greatly increase travel times. Likewise, wormholes can
							normally only bridge locations up to 200 or so light-years at a time (which means it would
							take about 500 jumps to cross the Milky Way galaxy from end to end).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Dark Drive:</strong> A dark drive (short for "dark matter quantum drive") uses
							enormous power to enable point-to-point transitions between other locations in the galaxy
							(or universe) using previously unrealized entanglement between normal matter and dark
							matter. However, objective travel time is variable and somewhat arbitrary; sometimes a trip
							may take minutes, other times days or months. For those aboard, relative travel time seems
							constant at about four solar hours, no matter the distance traveled, or the objective time
							noted by external observers.</p>

				<h4 id="extended-vehicular-combat">Extended Vehicular Combat<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#extended-vehicular-combat" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>When vehicular combat occurs&mdash;which happens whenever the PCs are completely enclosed in a
					vehicle so that it's not really the characters fighting, but the vehicles&mdash;start with the <a
						href="#action-vehicular-combat">vehicular combat</a> rules.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">However, if you'd like to provide the PCs with more options designed
					especially for spacecraft combat, use these optional rules instead, which include a "redline
					maneuver" system for trying extremely risky spacecraft maneuvers, bridge combat options, and more.
					The base vehicular combat rules have been integrated into these extended rules, so you don't need to
					continually cross-reference them to understand how it all works.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In extended vehicular combat, PCs on a spacecraft take actions on their turn,
					just like in a standard Cypher System combat encounter. Use standard <a
						href="#rules-encounters-rounds-and-initiative">initiative</a> rules to determine when PCs take
					their actions, and when enemy spacecraft take theirs. Characters will be crewing specific spacecraft
					system stations described under <a href="#extended-vehicular-combat-bridge-combat">Bridge
						Combat</a>, and thus could attempt a piloting maneuver, to fire the ship weapons, to scan the
					enemy craft for weaknesses, or to attempt some similar spacecraft operation task on their turn.
					Alternatively, they might be somewhere else on the ship attempting repairs, fighting off boarders,
					attempting to open communications in order to negotiate, or taking some other action.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For their part, enemy spacecraft are likely to fire on the same systems aboard
					a PCs' spacecraft as the ones the PCs are firing on (weapons, defenses, engines, or even a kill
					shot). The PC pilot rolls one or more defense rolls. The enemy spacecraft faces the same
					modifications the PCs face when targeting a particular system (as described hereafter), except those
					modifications ease or hinder the PC making the defense roll, since NPC craft never roll themselves.
					And, if an enemy ship manages to disable a system on the PCs' ship on an attack, PCs can attempt
					repair tasks to get those systems back online on their turns.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The main difference between spacecraft combat and regular combat is that the
					difficulty of tasks that the PCs attempt in relation to the enemy craft varies a lot more than in
					regular combat. In normal combat, a task difficulty is usually equal to the foe's level. But in
					spacecraft combat, a task difficulty is equal to a modified task difficulty (beginning with the
					spacecraft's level, but moving on from there, as noted hereafter). The modified difficulty always
					applies to anything characters attempt in regard to the enemy spacecraft, whether a PC fires at an
					enemy ship, dodges return fire, attempts to scan the enemy spacecraft, attempts to repair damage
					caused by the enemy spacecraft, and so on.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It's actually similar to a normal task. For example, when a PC scans a robot,
					the task difficulty is usually the robot's level, but not always. Sometimes the robot's effective
					level is modified because of intrinsic skills or systems the robot possesses, or because of
					something it does making it harder (or easier) for it to be scanned. In the case of spacecraft
					combat, modification is pretty much a given, and is even more variable. So variable, in fact, that a
					space combat status tracker has been provided. to turn potentially confusing conflicts into
					something as easy as looking at a marker to know what the difficulty for a particular task is.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The modifiers that apply, even before PCs attempt a specific combat task noted
					under <a href="#extended-vehicular-combat-bridge-combat">Bridge Combat</a>, are as follows.</p>
				<h5 id="extended-vehicular-combat-base-combat-task-modifiers">Base Combat Task Modifiers<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#extended-vehicular-combat-base-combat-task-modifiers"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The following modifiers change the effective level of the enemy of the spacecraft for a given task by
					hindering or easing a PC's roll. Track each change in effective level on the space combat status
					tracker.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Spacecraft Level Difference:</strong> Compare the levels of the spacecraft involved
							in the conflict. If the PCs' vehicle has the higher level, the difference in levels becomes
							a reduction in the difficulty of attack and defense rolls PCs might make. If the PCs'
							vehicle has the lower level, the difference is an increase in difficulty by the same amount.
							If the levels are the same, there is no modification.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Mismatched Tech Rating:</strong> It's possible that vehicles from different tech
							ratings will fight each other at some point, or become caught up in a larger multi-vehicle
							fight. When they do, each step difference in tech rating between two opposed vehicles
							increases the effective level of the higher-rated vehicle by two steps.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Vehicle Coordination:</strong> If two vehicles coordinate their attack against an
							enemy vehicle, the attack is eased. If three or more vehicles coordinate, the attack is
							eased by two steps.</p>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Superior Weapons, Defenses, or other Systems:</strong> Some vehicles have superior
							weapons or defenses, as noted in their descriptions. If a vehicle has a superior system,
							treat that vehicle as if one level higher than its actual level when figuring attacks or
							evasion tasks if that specific system is involved.</p>

					<p>Starcraft (and other vehicles) of a higher tech rating involved in vehicular combat with craft of

					<p>A spacecraft with some or all of the PCs crewing different systems stations will be more capable
						than a regular spacecraft in combat. Which means that an enemy spacecraft that might prove
						challenging based on its level might actually be fairly easily handled by PCs who fully
						understand their options.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">But be careful, because even competent PCs should fear squadrons of enemy
						ships, and military craft with several weapon systems. Even a single level difference is
						magnified, so make sure not to capriciously throw spacecraft at the PCs that are 2 levels higher
						than their own.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="extended-vehicular-combat-redline-maneuver">Redline Maneuver<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#extended-vehicular-combat-redline-maneuver" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a>
				</h5>
				<p>When someone with access to spacecraft controls attempts a particularly audacious and risky maneuver,
					it's a "redline" maneuver. Essentially, declaring a redline maneuver eases one task a PC attempts in
					a spacecraft under duress, but comes with a concomitant risk.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">To make a redline maneuver, a character spends 1 XP as a free action. In doing
					so, they unlock the option for all the PCs to attempt to redline for rest of the combat. To redline,
					a PC describes the dangerous thing they want to attempt, then takes that action. Mechanically, the
					PC eases the particular task they are attempting (which might just be to fire at the enemy craft's
					weapons), but increases the <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> range by two points.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character who redlines could opt to increase their gamble by easing a task
					by two steps or even more; however, each step increases the GM intrusion range by another two points
					that round.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Redline maneuvers are also available in desperate non-combat situations aboard
					a spacecraft. For example, Tammie's ship is caught in a decaying orbit over Venus, and the ship
					doesn't have enough power left to break out. She tells the GM that she's going to try an extremely
					risky maneuver that involves igniting ALL the remaining power at once, hoping that the explosive
					thrust will succeed in blowing the craft into a higher orbit. Because things are desperate, she
					commits to easing the task by two steps after paying 1 XP. This easing (plus any skill, application
					of Effort, and so on) gives her a pretty decent chance of succeeding, except the GM intrusion range
					is now 1&minus;5.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If a GM intrusion is triggered, something goes wrong. Remember that success
					might still be possible if the roll was high enough, but still falls within the increased GM
					intrusion range.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you're looking for inspiration for appropriate GM intrusions when a
					redlining PC triggers one, refer to suggested GM intrusions presented under <a
						href="#extended-vehicular-combat-bridge-combat">Bridge Combat</a> hereafter, each associated
					with a particular ship system that a character is probably crewing.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">After any round where a redline maneuver was attempted, the GM intrusion range
					returns to normal (1 on a 1d20) as the next round beings.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Multiple Redline Maneuvers:</strong> Only one PC needs to spend 1 XP to unlock redline
						maneuvers for themselves and for any other PCs aboard the same spacecraft for the duration of a
						single encounter. Multiple redline attempts during the same round by two or more PCs additively
						increase the GM intrusion range for that round. So, a PC attempting to redline who takes their
						turn after previous redline attempts that round faces a GM intrusion range that's already
						inflated, and which will inflate more when they redline. (PCs who do not redline during a
						particular round don't have to worry about the increasing GM intrusion range for their action.)
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Thus, while PCs do not need to pre-announce their intention to redline at the
					beginning of each round, coordinating wouldn't be a bad idea. Whichever PC redlines last in a round
					where redline maneuvers were already attempted could face a fairly significant GM intrusion range.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If <a href="#void-rules">Void Rules</a> are also being used and have
					triggered, redline maneuvers are even more dangerous.</p>
				<h5 id="extended-vehicular-combat-bridge-combat">Bridge Combat<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#extended-vehicular-combat-bridge-combat" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>If several PCs are aboard the same spacecraft, give them the following option: ask each PC to crew
					one of the ship system stations, including weapons (of which there could be more than one system,
					requiring more than one PC to crew them all), piloting, and science and engineering (which could be
					divided into two stations with similar functionality). A spacecraft generally has a number of system
					stations equal to its level. PCs on spacecraft that are lower level must flip between system
					controls as part of another action, using two stations or even just one station for the whole ship.
					Even if a PC flips a station (reconfigures, as engineers like to say), only a single PC can crew a
					station (and take an action using it) each round.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When crewing their stations, PCs have several station-specific options
					available to them. What they do can bears on how the encounter plays out on a round-to-round basis,
					similar to regular combat. Specific options are provided for each station, but characters are free
					to attempt other actions they can think of.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The following ship systems might be found on larger spacecraft with room for
					more than a single pilot.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>Shipmind System Control:</strong> Some ships with integrated AIs (<a
							href="#robots-and-ai-shipmind">shipminds</a>) can control a particular system autonomously,
						without a PC. When it acts in this fashion, it can only take a single action each round, which
						means it could attack and move, but not also attempt a complicated engineering or defensive
						maneuver. A shipmind acts at a level equal to the overall spacecraft. In addition, shipmind
						actions against an enemy spacecraft are assessed with the same modifiers for targeting as a PC
						crewing the station.</p>

					<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
						<li>
							<p><strong>Know your stuff:</strong> First, familiarize yourself with the material.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Assign characters a station:</strong> Next, if you have some time to prepare,
								copy the two-page spread containing the various PC system options, and give one to each
								player. Tell them to figure out what stations they are crewing, based on the number of
								systems their ship has (usually no more systems than the level of the ship). You will
								probably also have to explain the basics.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Deploy space combat status tracker:</strong> Also make a copy of the one-page
								space combat status tracker and set it on the table so everyone can see. It'll make a
								huge difference in how your space combat plays out. The status tracker allows you (and
								the players) to easily mark the difficulty of current space combat task a PC is
								attempting, without having to hold all the easing and hindering in your heads, or having
								to write them out each time.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Space Combat Status Tracker Instructions:</strong> Using dice (or similar
								objects) as markers, track the difficulty of the current task that a PC is attempting,
								as well as the <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> range for that round if any
								character is attempting to redline. Place the marker in the column appropriate to the
								kind of task being attempted (attack, defense, or other) at the starting difficulty
								level. If the PCs face more than one enemy spacecraft, use different colored dice to
								represent different ships, or separate copies of this status tracker for each additional
								enemy spacecraft.</p>
							<p>At the end of each full round, reset all the markers on the tracker to their base state,
								unless some effect causes a modification that lasts longer than a round. Be sure to
								reset the GM intrusion marker, too.</p>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Roll initiative:</strong> Begin the combat, with the enemy spacecraft of your
								choice taking on the PCs' ship. Decide whether the enemy spacecraft are already in
								weapon range (it's your call, we're not tracking that here), and if not, how soon they
								will be close enough to begin attacking, and let the combat flow</p>

				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Spacecraft vs. Colossal Creatures:</strong> If a creature is as capable as a
							spacecraft, treat it that way when it comes to vehicular combat. Instead of adjusting for
							mismatched tech rating, treat the creature's effective level as if three levels less than
							its actual level. Extrapolate "weapon systems" to the creature's attack methods, defenses to
							its weird organic plating, and so on. Killing such a creature means taking out its "power
							core or other vital spot."</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Spacecraft vs. Regular Creatures:</strong> If a vehicle weapon system fires on an
							unprotected PC (or a PC in a spacecraft fires ship weapons on a creature outside the craft
							that isn't colossal), it's an entirely different situation. Attacks against a vehicle's
							systems face all the previously mentioned modifiers. On top of that, add an additional five
							steps of hindrance to attacks by a regular creature against a starcraft.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A PC defending from a spacecraft's attack is hindered by five steps. Except in this case, the
					spacecraft inflicts damage. Given that ship weapons compared to handheld weapons are an order of
					magnitude apart when it comes to power, a good rule of thumb is that a spacecraft's weapon inflicts
					25 points of damage on a successful hit and knocks the character one step down <a

				<p>If a supercomputer can think independently, it's a strong AI (an artificial intelligence). Though not
					as advanced as godminds, AIs can develop inscrutable goals.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">AIs take many forms. Some are distributed across a vast network. Others are
					encoded into a singular "computer core." A few are machines with organic parts. All are entities of
					extreme intelligence able to adapt to new situations, and most act on some kind of plan, whether
					long-acting, or newly concocted to fit the situation at hand.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">

							damage from electricity (or 10 points of Intellect damage, which ignores Armor).</p>
						<p>Some AIs can take an action to absorb matter around them (such as walls, floor, equipment,
							unresisting living creatures, and so on), regaining 5 points of health.</p>
						<p>An AI is likely able to deploy cyphers and artifacts in combat and also relies on guardians
							(such as synthetic people made to its own design) to aid it. Unless a particular AI uses a

							seemingly destroyed, it might exist as another instance somewhere else.</p>

						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Some AIs enjoy negotiation. Others simply ignore humans as

					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> The characters are contacted by an AI sympathetic to biological beings.

					manufactured by a post-singularity AI for some unfathomable purpose, or even the result of banned
					weapons research by a nation-state or conglomerate. The human remnants in each cybrid's carbon fiber
					and nested shells of nanotech exist in a red haze of pain; neuro-wetware and chemicals bathing their
					remaining living tissues hold the pain partly at bay.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">From the exterior, not much of the original human is obvious, except perhaps
					in the echo of a humanoid shape. Each one has a unique conformation, but all are designed to strike

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Cybrids can attack up to three foes that they can see up to about

							caught in the beam who succeed on a Speed defense roll still suffer 2 points of damage. If
							the cybrid focuses on a single target, treat the attack as a level 10 attack that inflicts
							14 points of damage, or 6 points even on a successful Speed defense roll.</p>
						<p>Self-repair mechanisms allow the creature to regain 2 points of health per round.</p>

						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> If communication can be opened up through a cybrid's haze of

				<p>Conglomerate security subsidiaries regularly experiment with new ways to create super-soldiers,

					produced hundreds of dead ends&mdash;literally&mdash;plus a few dangerous failures. The devolved are
					one of those dangerous failures. These malformed, hideous brutes share a common heritage but display
					a wide array of maladies and mutations in the flesh, including withered limbs or elephantine patches
					of thick, scaly skin, misplaced body parts, and mental abnormalities. Simple-minded and afflicted
					with pain from their twisted, broken forms, the devolved vent all their hatred and wrath against all
					others.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Even successfully created super-soldiers require a regular regimen of

				<p>Tiny nanomachines can be incredibly useful tools. But they can also become a terrible threat. Like
					cells in a living body that develop cancer, these out-of-control self-replicating robots can consume
					everything in their path while building more of themselves. A typical swarm is about 6 m (20 feet)
					in diameter, individually consisting of millions of individual minuscule machines. However, several
					swarms can act together, creating a much larger cloud of death with just one purpose: to eat and
					replicate. Able to move large distances by gliding through the air, cloud-like swarms take on
					intriguing shapes and ripple with mathematical patterns as they approach a potential target,
					beautiful and deadly.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Ecophagic swarms sometimes build weird structures or artifacts in the wake of

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> As a mass of countless tiny machines, an ecophagic swarm can flow
							around obstacles and squeeze through cracks large enough to permit a single sub-millimeter
							machine. That includes over and around other creatures. Characters touched by a leading
							edge&mdash;or wholly enveloped within the hazy "body"&mdash;of an ecophagic swarm must
							succeed on a Might defense task or take 4 points of damage. If the character doesn't wear
							armor of some kind, they take 1 point of damage even if they succeed.</p>
						<p>For its part, an ecophagic swarm ignores any attack that targets a single creature (unless
							it's an electrical attack), but it takes normal damage from attacks that affect an area (and
							electrical attacks), such as a detonation. A swarm cannot enter liquids, unless it takes
							about an hour to build new subunits that are aquatic.</p>

					diameter moldlike blobs. Exoslimes possess independent minds, but in some settings may be
					manufactured entities designed to explore new locations, interact with aliens, or subjugate aliens.
					Exoslimes can learn to respect the autonomy of other creatures, though their natural instinct is to
					absorb novel objects and creatures they discover in order to learn about them. Exoslimes can also
					replicate anything they absorb, even a previously eaten living intelligent being.</p>

				<p>Unfathomably powerful post-singularity AIs, godminds are vast, having used the matter of an entire

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A godmind can vary the physical laws of the universe within a

							inflicting 15 points of damage on all creatures within very long range, attempt to put a
							target into temporal stasis, send a target (even a target as large as spacecraft) through a
							temporary wormhole gate, and so on. It could also scan the memory banks of any digital
							machine, and possibly of any living creatures. In any event, if an instance were targeted,
							and successfully neutralized or even destroyed, the godmind itself isn't harmed. An
							aggressor would have to find the godmind's primeval "computer core" to destroy one, likely
							an epic quest in and of itself.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> To actually get a godmind's attention and negotiate could
							require ancient command code, finding an old input device, or showing up with a relic from
							an ancient ultra or other prize. If a godmind does render aid, it's likely to be in a form
							that is initially enigmatic, though ultimately extremely powerful.</p>

				<p>Hungry hazes are found in regions where the fundamental laws of physics have been eroded or are weak.
					They are named for how they appear as distortions of sight, like areas of heat haze, that shimmer in

							a hungry haze is reduced to zero health, a smooth thumb-sized egg of unknown material is
							left behind.</p>
					</li>

						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> A hungry haze does not speak or seem to have language. But it

				<p>Some alien beings abandoned their physical forms millennia ago, becoming entities of free-floating

					permutations they discover. They sometimes appear as a silhouette of gently glowing light, in a form
					like to the alien species they wish to observe. Under circumstances where a shining one is moved to
					more directly interact, one can actually convert itself into matter once more, again taking on the
					biology and form of the species it wishes to interact with. But generally, shining ones observe and
					learn; they try not to interfere or interact. Every few thousand years, shining ones gather at a
					predetermined location on the edge of a convenient galaxy and share the most interesting and

							fights for its existence with energy blasts inflicting 6 points of damage on up to two
							different targets within very long range (or the same target twice).</p>
						<p> Alternatively, a shining one may attempt to discorporate a target, turning it into a being

				</h5>
				<p>Vacuum fungus is sometimes found as a greenish ooze on the exterior of spacecraft or space stations,
					growing in fine lines through the ice of frozen moons, and infesting the center of small asteroids
					and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Though able to survive in vacuum, the fungus takes on new morphology
					when sufficient spores find their way into habitable zero-G spaces. Then they fuse together and grow
					into a bulbous, emerald-hued fruiting body, typically reaching about 1 m (3 feet) in rough diameter,
					though individuals can grow much larger if not discovered. Sticky and soft to the touch, they are
					able to grow undetected in the dark corners of cargo holds, in ductworks, hanging from the ceiling
					of unused crew quarters, and so on.</p>
				<p>Vacuum fungus may be proof that extra-terrestrial life exists, but that triumph of scientific
					discovery may seem less important to those who find a clump, because they are incredibly toxic to
					living creatures.</p>

				<p>Wharn interceptors are void-adapted behemoths, several hundred meters in length. It's hypothesized
					that they are living battle automatons devised by ancient ultras, though against what long-vanished
					enemy isn't clear. Now, a handful (hopefully no more) glide through the depths of space like dormant

					how many millennia they passed in this apparently hibernating state? But when that hibernation ends,
					maybe because some ancient countdown is nearing its end, or because an asteroid miner tried to
					extract a sample, they open eyes burning with deadly energy, and flex claws of particle-beam fury.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Wharn interceptors may be related in some fashion omworwars, so much so that

				<p>Wraiths (Homo vacuus) are genetically engineered to live in the vacuum of space by directly

					wraiths are partners with humans, working in locations where humans would find difficult. In other
					settings, wraiths went their own way generations earlier, and rediscovering them would be a first

					they entombed in nearby solids, phased into another dimension, or do they simply not exist until

				<p>Horror games allow us to explore some pretty dark topics from the safety of our own game tables. But
					before you do that, make sure everyone around your table is okay with that. Find out what your
					players will find "good uncomfortable," which is something that makes us squirm in our seats in a
					great horror movie, and "bad uncomfortable," which is something that actually makes a player feel
					nauseated, unsafe, or offended. Being scared can be fun, but being sickened isn't.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Consider the age and maturity of everyone in the game, perhaps in terms of the
					movie rating system. Tell the players what you think the game you're running would be rated. If
					everyone's okay with an R rating, then fine. You can have a spooky game that's on the level of a
					kids' movie rated G&mdash;more like Scooby-Doo than Saw, in other words. A PG rating might be right
					for a game that's more creepy than horrific, with ghosts and spooky noises but not axe-wielding
					maniacs.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The different ratings suggest different kinds of content for your game.
					Finding a dead body is horrible, but watching someone get decapitated is something else entirely.
					Getting chased around by an alien that wants to eat you is one thing, but having it gestate and
					burst out of your own intestines is another. You need to know where the line is for everyone
					participating, and you need to know it right from the beginning.</p>

				<h4 id="horror-shock">Optional Rule: Shock<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#horror-shock"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>When the PCs encounter something shocking, many times the most realistic response is to scream, stand
					in abject horror, or run. That might not be the smartest thing to do in the situation, but it's
					genuine. What would your accountant do if they saw an axe-wielding maniac coming at them? Let's face
					it, unless they truly steeled themselves with all their will, they'd probably scream and run.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When a PC encounters something horrific, utterly disgusting, dreadful,
					impossible, or otherwise shocking, call for an Intellect defense roll based on the level of the
					creature involved, or simply an appropriate level as decided by the GM (see the Shock Levels table).
					Failure might mean that for one round, the player loses control of the character, and the GM decides
					what the PC does next. This usually means that the character runs, screams, gibbers, stares
					slack-jawed, or just does nothing. However, GMs should welcome player input into this situation. The
					point is to portray that when we're shocked, we don't always react in the best way, the smartest
					way, or even the way we want to. Fear is a powerful thing.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Alternatively, failure on the Intellect defense roll might mean that the
					character suffers Intellect damage equal to the level of the defense task. This indicates an overall
					toll that numerous shocks and horrors can have on a person. You might have a situation where a
					character literally dies of fright.</p>

				<h4 id="horror-mode">Optional Rule: Horror Mode<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#horror-mode"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>For horror games, GMs can implement a rule called Horror Mode. The idea is to create a feeling of
					escalating dread and menace by changing one die roll mechanic. In the game, things begin as normal.
					The PCs interact with each other and the NPCs, investigate, research, travel, and so on. But when
					they enter the haunted house, the serial killer gets close, the elder things beneath the earth
					awaken, or whatever horrific situation planned by the GM begins, things change. At this time, the GM
					announces that the game has gone into Horror Mode.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This is a key for the players (not the characters) to recognize that things
					are getting bad. It's the RPG equivalent of spooky music beginning to play in a horror film. While
					in Horror Mode, the rules for GM intrusions governed by die rolls change. Normally this happens only
					on a roll of 1, but when Horror Mode starts, it becomes a roll of 1 or 2. And then it escalates. As
					time passes, GM intrusions happen on a roll of 1 to 3, then a roll of 1 to 4, and so on. This
					potentially means that a die roll in Horror Mode can indicate success in a task and still trigger a
					GM intrusion.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As the intrusion range changes with each escalation, the GM should announce
					this to the players. The feeling of rising tension should be dramatic and overt.</p>
				<h5 class="og-csrd-header-small" id="horror-escalation-rate">Escalation Rate<a

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, while the PCs are exploring a dark swamp (a large area), the game
					goes into Horror Mode and intrusions are indicated on a 1 or 2. During this exploration, one of the
					players rolls a 2. Not only is there an intrusion, but now the range escalates to 1, 2, or 3. The
					character is almost dragged into a spot of quicksand-like muck. Then the PCs find an old abandoned
					house in the middle of the swamp. They enter, and now the escalation rate goes up if they roll a 1,
					2, or 3, or every ten minutes that passes in the game. They explore the house for twenty minutes
					(escalating intrusions to 1 to 5), and during the investigation of the kitchen, someone rolls a 3,
					triggering an intrusion. A cabinet opens mysteriously and a strangely carved clay pot falls,
					striking the character. This also escalates the intrusion rate, so they now occur on a roll of 1 to
					6. When the PCs reach the attic, they encounter the dreaded swamp slayer, a half man, half beast
					that thrives on blood. It attacks, and now the range goes up during each round of combat. After four
					rounds of fighting, intrusions happen on a roll of 1 to 10&mdash;half the time. Things are getting
					dicey, and they're only going to get worse.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When the GM announces that Horror Mode has ended, the <a
						href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> rate goes back to normal, happening only on a roll of 1 or
					when the GM awards XP.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Horror Mode is a very "meta" rule. It gives players knowledge that their characters don't have.
						This is similar to how the viewers of a horror movie or readers of a horror story often know
						more than the characters on the screen or page. It heightens the tension. Players can express
						the start of Horror Mode by having their characters talk about goosebumps or a feeling of being
						watched, but this is not necessary.</p>

				<h5 id="using-gm-intrusions-in-horror-mode">Using GM Intrusions in Horror Mode<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#using-gm-intrusions-in-horror-mode" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>With the GM intrusions coming fast and furious toward the end of Horror Mode, it's easy to run out of
					ideas. In combat, intrusions might just mean that the monster or villain gets a surprise extra
					attack or inflicts more damage. Perhaps a PC is thrown to the ground or nearer to the edge of a
					cliff. If the characters are running away, one might trip and fall. If the PCs are exploring, a
					bookcase topples, potentially hitting someone. Think of all the similar moments you've seen in
					horror films.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes, if the GM prefers, the GM intrusion can simply be something
					frightening, like a moan or a whisper. These aren't dangerous to the PCs, but they escalate the
					tension and indicate that something bad is getting closer.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In fact, while in Horror Mode, GMs should mostly refrain from doing anything
					bad, ominous, or dangerous unless it's an intrusion (either from a die roll or through the awarding
					of XP). In a horror game, GM intrusions are an indication that things are bad and getting worse, and
					whenever possible, the GM should allow the Horror Mode escalation to drive the action. This makes
					the GM more of a slave to the dice than in other Cypher System situations, but that's okay.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Consider this example. The PCs have tracked something that is probably
					committing a series of horrific murders to an old factory. They enter the building to explore. The
					GM knows where the creature is hiding in the factory, but decides that it doesn't become aware of
					the characters until an intrusion is indicated. The only clue the PCs have is a mysterious noise off
					in the darkness. The creature doesn't move toward them until another GM intrusion occurs. Now they
					hear something dragging across the factory floor, coming closer. But it's not until a third
					intrusion occurs that the creature lunges out from behind an old machine at the PC who rolled the
					die.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In some ways, the status quo doesn't change until an intrusion happens. This
					could be seen as limiting the GM and the need for pacing, but remember that the GM can still have an
					intrusion occur anytime they desire, in addition to waiting for the low die rolls.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>GMs may want to limit the number of intrusions to no more than one per round, no matter what the
						dice indicate, but that should be based on the situation.</p>

				<hr>
				<h4 id="horror-madness">Optional Rule: Madness<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#horror-madness"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Having characters descend into madness is an interesting facet of some kinds of horror and can make
					long-term horror campaigns more interesting. The easiest way to portray blows to a character's
					sanity is through Intellect damage. When PCs encounter something shocking, as described above, they
					always take Intellect damage. If they would normally move one step down <a
						href="#the-damage-track">the damage track</a> due to the damage, they instead immediately regain
					points (equal to 1d6 + their tier) in their Intellect Pools but lose 1 point from their maximums in
					that Pool. Characters whose Intellect Pools reach 0 go insane. They lose their current descriptor
					and adopt the <a href="#descriptor-mad">Mad</a> descriptor, regain 1d6 + tier points to their
					Intellect Pools, and gain +1 to their Intellect Edge. If they ever reach a permanent Intellect Pool
					maximum of 0 again, they go stark raving mad and are no longer playable.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Intellect Edge offers an interesting means to portray a character who is
					knowledgeable (and perhaps even powerful in terms of mental abilities) yet mentally fragile. A
					character with a low Intellect Pool but a high Intellect Edge can perform Intellect actions well
					(since Edge is very helpful) but is still vulnerable to Intellect damage (where Edge is of no help).
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Since Cypher System games are meant to be story based, players should
					recognize that the degrading sanity of their character is part of the story. A player who feels that
					their character is going mad can talk to the GM, and the two of them can work out the means to
					portray that&mdash;perhaps by using the <a href="#descriptor-mad">Mad</a> descriptor, permanently
					trading up to 4 points from their Intellect Pool to gain +1 to their Intellect Edge, or anything
					else that seems appropriate. Mental disorders, manias, psychopathy, schizophrenia, or simple phobias
					can be added to a character's traits, but they don't need to be quantified in game statistics or die
					rolls. They're simply part of the character.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Inabilities in personal interaction or any area requiring focus might be
					appropriate, perhaps allowing the PC to gain training in weird lore or forbidden knowledge. Or maybe
					the opposite is true&mdash;as the character's mind slowly slips away, they become oddly compelled or
					can obsessively focus on a single task for indefinite periods, and thus they gain training in that
					topic or skill. These kinds of changes could be balanced with inabilities, such as being unable to
					remember important details.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As another way to represent madness, the GM could hinder Intellect-based tasks
					that would be considered routine, such as "remembering your friends and family" or "caring what
					happens to your best friend" or "stopping yourself from injecting a mysterious substance into your
					veins." These routine tasks normally have a difficulty of 0, but for a PC who has lost their mind,
					they might have a difficulty of 1, 2, or even higher. Now the character must make rolls to do even
					those simple things.</p>

					Romance
				</h3>
				<p>Like horror, romance doesn't automatically suggest a setting. It is more of a mood, or more
					specifically an approach, to how the game is played. It suggests an emphasis, at least somewhat, on
					relationships, interactions, and connections.</p>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">

				<h4 id="romance-consent-and-boundaries">Consent and Boundaries<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#romance-consent-and-boundaries" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>You must get consent to cover these topics in a game ahead of time&mdash;you don't want to make
					people uncomfortable. Everyone involved also needs to learn everyone else's boundaries. Someone
					might not want any part of a romance scene, while others are okay talking about emotional
					connections but not anything sexual.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Obviously, all of this is doubly important if age is a consideration. If there
					are younger players involved, romance probably shouldn't go beyond a fairly chaste kiss. (You'll
					find that kids are sometimes more open to romance in their games than adults, but only because their
					understanding of the topic is understandably pretty shallow. A kid player might declare that a
					character is their boyfriend, but it doesn't mean much. And for some adults, that may be the way
					they want to approach the subject as well.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Lastly, recognize that there needs to be a clear boundary between the story
					and real life. Two characters having a relationship has no impact on real-life feelings of the
					players. Two characters in a game might be in a relationship while each player is in a relationship
					in the real world with someone else. And maybe they're gaming at the same table! If a player can't
					distinguish between in-game flirtation or words of endearment and real-world feelings, they
					shouldn't be in a romance-focused game.</p>

						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>It's vital that the GM and the players all check in with each other to make sure everyone's still
					comfortable with what's going on in the game. This is particularly important to maintain the
					boundary between emotions expressed in the story and how people feel in real life.</p>

				<h4 id="optional-rule-infatuation">Optional Rule: Infatuation<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#optional-rule-infatuation" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>When a PC is near someone they are infatuated with, particularly in the early stages of that
					infatuation, they must make an Intellect defense roll with a difficulty determined by the GM based
					on the situation (not on the level of the subject of the infatuation). Failure might mean that the
					character does or says something awkward or embarrassing either in an attempt to impress or when
					trying to hide the infatuation. Or it could mean that for one round, the player loses control of the
					character, and the GM decides what the PC does next, such as risk their own safety to help an
					endangered character. However, GMs should welcome player input into this situation. The point is to
					portray that when we're distracted by the powerful feelings (and hormones) related to infatuation,
					we don't always react in the best way, the smartest way, or even the way we want to.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Infatuation can happen whether the PC is attracted to an NPC or a PC.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="optional-rule-relationship-levels">Optional Rule: Relationship Levels<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#optional-rule-relationship-levels" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>When a PC first establishes a relationship with a character (PC or NPC), the GM should assign the
					relationship a level. If there's no connection at all, there is no relationship (level 0).
					Otherwise, the starting relationship is probably level 1. In certain circumstances, a relationship
					might start at level 2, indicating a far stronger initial connection than usual.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As play progresses, the PC can attempt to improve the level of the
					relationship, indicating a strengthening of the bond between the two characters. The requirements to
					improve the relationship are twofold. First, some story-based action needs to be taken. This can be
					dates, gifts, a meaningful speech, a pledge of commitment, some amount of self-sacrifice, or
					whatever the GM and the player feel is appropriate to the story and the level of the relationship.
					This action might require the PC to succeed at specific tasks (with appropriate rolls). For example,
					writing a love poem will require an Intellect-based task, while helping to retrieve a loved one's
					cat from a tree might require a Speed-based task.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Second, the player must make an Intellect-based roll with the desired level of
					relationship as the difficulty (modified as the GM sees fit).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A relationship can be improved only one level at a time, and the GM and the
					player should work out an appropriate time interval. For relationships of levels 5 and above,
					multiple story-based actions and multiple rolls are almost certainly required.</p>

				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>It's possible for relationship levels to be lopsided, such that the relationship from the point
						of view of one person is a different level than from the point of view of the other. This should
						be used sparingly, because it makes things far more complicated. In the case of polyamory, it is
						possible to have more than two people in a relationship, but even in these situations the
						connection between any two individuals should have its own level.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Relationship levels can go down as well as up. Neglect, carelessness,
					inappropriate emotional displays, lies, infidelity, and bungled wooing attempts can all potentially
					lower a relationship level. This is entirely in the judgment of the GM, although a lowered
					relationship level is very likely an appropriate use of a GM intrusion.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Relationship levels indicate the strength of the bond and thus help dictate an
					NPC's actions in regard to a PC. An NPC in a level 5 relationship probably will be more generous and
					forgiving toward the PC than if the relationship was level 3 or 4. An NPC in a level 6 relationship
					or higher would likely give their partner most anything, even maybe sacrificing their own well-being
					or their life for them. (And people in a higher-level relationship certainly would.) Likewise, a
					relationship level can influence a PC's actions. An Intellect defense roll with a difficulty equal
					to the relationship level might be appropriate if the PC wants to act against the best interests of
					their loved one, or if they must keep their cool and act normally when their loved one is in danger.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">You can use this optional system in any genre, for any type of relationship,
					even platonic ones. If desired, the relationship level a PC has with an authority figure, a contact,
					a relative, or anyone else can be measured, improved, and decreased just as it can with a romantic
					relationship.</p>

				<h4 id="optional-rule-power-shifts">Optional Rule: Power Shifts<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#optional-rule-power-shifts" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Superheroes can do things that other people cannot. They throw cars, blast through brick walls, leap
					onto speeding trains, and cobble together interdimensional gateways in a few hours. It's tempting to
					say that such characters are stronger, faster, or smarter, so they should have higher Might, Speed,
					or Intellect Pools. However, simply bumping up stat Pools or Edge doesn't fully represent this
					dramatic increase in power. Instead, consider using an optional rule called power shifts.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Under this rule, all superhero characters get five power shifts. Power shifts
					are like permanent levels of Effort that are always active. They don't count toward a character's
					maximum Effort use (nor do they count as skills or assets). They simply ease tasks that fall into
					specific categories, which include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> All attack rolls</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Movement, acrobatics, <a
								href="#rules-encounters-rounds-and-initiative">initiative</a>, and Speed defense</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Healing:</strong> One extra <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a> per shift
							(each one action, all coming before other normal recovery rolls)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Intellect defense rolls and all knowledge, science, and
							crafting tasks</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Power:</strong> Use of a specific power, including damage (3 additional points per
							shift) but not attack rolls</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Resilience:</strong> Might defense rolls and Armor (+1 per shift)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Single Attack:</strong> Attack rolls and damage (3 additional points per shift)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Strength:</strong> All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing damage
							in melee or thrown attacks (3 additional points of damage per shift) but not attack rolls
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each shift eases the task (except for shifts that affect damage or Armor, as
					specified in the list above). Applying 2 shifts eases the task by two steps, and applying 3 shifts
					eases the task by three steps.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most characters
					should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one category. Once the shifts are assigned,
					they should not change.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, a superstrong character might put three of their shifts into
					strength and the other two into resilience. Whenever they lift something heavy, smash through a
					wall, or throw an object, they ease the task by three steps before applying Effort, skill, or
					assets. Thus, all difficulties from 0 to 3 are routine for them. They smash through level 3 doors as
					if they don't exist. As another example, a masked vigilante character with a utility belt full of
					gadgets and great acrobatic skills might put two shifts in dexterity, one in accuracy, one in
					intelligence, and one in healing. They're not actually superpowered, just tough and well trained.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some GMs will want to allow PCs to increase their power shifts. Having a
					character spend 10 XP to do so would probably be appropriate. Other GMs will want to run superhero
					games with PCs of greater or lesser power (cosmic-level heroes or street-level heroes, perhaps). In
					such cases, more or fewer power shifts should be granted to the PCs at the game's start.</p>

							title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
					<p>NPC superheroes and villains get power shifts, too. Most of the time, this adds to their level.
						For example, Blast Star is a level 5 fiery villain who has three power shifts. When she blasts
						through a level 7 iron security door, she does so easily because in this circumstance, she's
						actually level 8.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes, NPC power shifts make things harder for the PCs. For example,
						Fleetfoot the level 4 speedster puts all three of her shifts in dexterity. When she runs past a
						character who tries to grab her, the difficulty to do so is increased by three steps to 7.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">Typical NPC supers get three power shifts. Exceptional ones usually have

				<p>In superhero games, due to conventions of the genre, difficulty caps at 15 instead of 10. Difficulty
					10 is labeled "impossible," but that label is for regular folks. For superpowered characters,
					"impossible" means something different, thanks to <a href="#optional-rule-power-shifts">power

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Think of each difficulty above 10 as being one more step beyond impossible.
					Although a GM in another genre would say there's no chance that a character could leap 100 feet (30
					m) from one rooftop to another, in a superhero game, that might just be difficulty 11. Picking up a
					city bus isn't something normal characters could do, but for a strong superhero, it might be
					difficulty 12.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In theory, NPCs in such a game can go up to level 15 as well. Levels above 10

				<p>The supervillain called Anathema is big, bright red, and stronger than anyone on this planet or any

					any hit and always gives back twice as hard as he receives. He can bring down buildings with a punch
					and throw semi trucks across state lines.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Before he was Anathema, he was Sameer Stokes, a bitter and spiteful coder
					working for a large software company. Having failed in relationships, promotions, and retaining
					friends, Sameer retreated online and learned that he had power when he bullied people. He delighted
					in causing emotional distress in others in forums and social media. In effect, he was a troll. When
					the metamorphosis happened, he was turned into a troll for real. (Sameer doesn't recall the
					metamorphosis or the days before and immediately after his change, despite using therapy and drugs
					in an attempt to recover those memories.)</p>

				<p>Doctor Dread is larger than life thanks to her brilliant mind, her media savvy, and the robotic armor
					she uses to enhance her otherwise normal abilities. Indeed, Doctor Dread has become the most feared
					terrorist on the planet. She uses her abilities to extort money, influence, and technology from the
					rich and powerful, whether her victims are individuals, governments, corporations, or superheroes.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Alicia Coleridge is Doctor Dread's secret identity. Born into relative
					obscurity, she received a full scholarship to the Russell Institute of Technology, where she studied
					the effects of radioactive substances on living tissue. In a freak lab accident, Alicia's fiancé was
					slain, and Alicia was disfigured and driven slightly insane, so much so that she built the Doctor
					Dread armor. She plows the vast wealth she accumulates through terrorism into research into the
					rejuvenation of dead flesh. She hopes to one day bring back her dead love, whose body she keeps in

						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Not much is known about Magnetar other than its powerful ability to generate and control magnetic
					fields. Various research groups theorize that Magnetar is an alien, a sentient and self-improving
					robot, or even some kind of manifestation of a fundamental force. Given Magnetar's vaguely humanoid
					shape, a few people even suggest that the villain is actually a man with a mutant ability so
					powerful that it burned out all memories of his former self.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In truth, Magnetar is the animate, sentient, and self-regulating nucleus of a
					neutron star that is able to rein in its immense electromagnetic signature. One of two such beings
					an advanced alien species created from a single magnetar (a type of neutron star with an extremely
					powerful magnetic field), Magnetar was sent on a mission of exploration. After millennia, it crashed
					on Earth and was damaged. Having lost most of its memory data, Magnetar knows that something was
					taken from it (its twin), but it can't remember what. It has decided to blame the humans.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Magnetar's fist packs a wallop, since it can selectively add mass to
							the punch. However, its most potent ability is its level 11 control over all metal within
							very long range, which it uses to create anything it can imagine, including walls, attacks,
							pincers, and more. Magnetar can lift bridges, vehicles, and structures infused with rebar
							that it can see within its area of influence. When it throws such a large object as part of
							an attack, the target and everything within short range of the target takes 10 points of
							damage.</p>
						<p>Magnetar's only weakness is psychic attacks, which is fortunate since reducing it to 0 health

					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Morose and gruff, Magnetar would rather be alone, but every so

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Anyone who spends too much time in Mister Genocide's presence becomes ill,

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When victims are killed by Mister Genocide's poison, their skin and the whites

				<p>The head of an elite group of assassins, Wrath wants to save the world by killing everyone who
					impedes her vision of perfection&mdash;which turns out to be the better part of humanity. In
					addition to being one of the most accomplished martial artists to walk the earth (thanks to her
					connection with a mystical entity called the Demon), Wrath is also a criminal mastermind whose
					assassins are just one layer of the organization she controls.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Born more than two hundred and fifty years ago in China to a name lost to
					history, Wrath was taken in by a monastery and trained in the ways of fist and sword. Everything
					changed when raiders attacked and killed everyone in her monastery, leaving her the sole survivor.
					Vowing revenge against the raiders and the world that allowed animals like them to exist, she
					acquired a magical amulet that contains the Demon. The Demon in turn bequeathed her extraordinary
					speed, strength, and longevity.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Wrath is content to let her assassins (and mobsters, lawyers, and politicians)
					accomplish many of her goals, though she relishes being present when particularly important
					adversaries are brought down.</p>

					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Wrath is arrogant and confident, though not so much that she is

					Post-Apocalyptic
				</h3>
				<p>Post-apocalyptic literature, movies, and games are a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on the
					dystopia that follows the fall of civilization. Strictly speaking, post-apocalyptic stories take
					place after the end of the world. At least, the end of the world for most people. Players take the
					role of the survivors (or their descendants) trying to persevere in the face of immense hardship.
					Popular post-apocalyptic scenarios include those set after nuclear war, in the aftermath of a zombie
					plague, in the months and years following an alien invasion, or after the environment collapses in
					the face of human overpopulation. Other ways the world could end include a massive meteorite strike,
					the long-awaited robot uprising, a powerful solar flare that burns out the world's power grids and
					communications, or even something as prosaic as a global disease pandemic.</p>

				<h4 id="scavenging">Scavenging<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#scavenging" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Characters in a post-apocalyptic setting must usually spend part of each day scavenging for supplies
					or a place of safety.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Food and Shelter:</strong> Generally speaking, characters must spend two to four
							hours searching through the rubble and ruins before succeeding. Finding enough food for a
							group of characters to eat for one day is a difficulty 5 Intellect task. Finding a place of
							relative safety to regroup and rest is also difficulty 5. Characters who succeed on either
							one of these also get to roll up to once each day on the Useful Stuff table and three times
							on the Junk table.</p>
						<p>Found food often takes the form of canned, processed, dried, or otherwise preserved goods
							from before the apocalypse, but sometimes it includes fresh fruits and vegetables found
							growing wild or cultivated by other survivors. Safe places to hole up include homes, RVs,
							offices, apartments, or any location that can be secured and defended and isn't radioactive,
							poisoned, or overrun with hostile creatures.</p>
						<p>The difficulty of succeeding at finding food, water, and a safe place varies by location and
							by how many days the characters have already spent in one location. Each week the PCs spend
							at the same location hinders subsequent scavenging tasks and requires that they succeed on a
							new task to determine if the place they're staying is still safe. The result of failing to
							find food and water is obvious. If the PCs fail at the task of finding (or keeping) a safe
							place, their presence is noticed by hostile forces, or they face a result from wasteland
							threats.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Useful Stuff:</strong> Food, water, and a safe place to rest are the most important
							finds, and are the basis of each scavenging task. But other obviously useful stuff is often
							found along with these basic requirements. When a group of characters successfully finds
							either food and water or a safe place, consult the Useful Stuff table up to once per day. If
							it's the first day the PCs have searched in a particular area, each character might find
							something useful, but in succeeding days, a group normally gets only a single roll to find
							useful stuff.</p>
						<p>Useful stuff also includes a "loot" entry. Loot includes collectible coins from before the
							apocalypse, such as silver dollars and gold eagles. It also includes jewelry and artwork
							that survived the disaster and related material that can be used as currency or barter when
							the characters find other survivors or arrive at a trade town.</p>
						<p>Items found on the Useful Stuff table are generally expensive or exorbitant items (except for
							firearms, which start in the expensive category).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Junk:</strong> Characters who find food and water also find lots of junk. They are
							free to ignore that junk, but some PCs might have a use for what they find, especially those
							with the Scavenges focus. All characters gain up to three results on the Junk table each
							time they successfully scavenge for food or a safe place to stay. Sometimes junk can be
							fixed, but more often it can be disassembled and used as parts to create something else.</p>

					Fairy Tale
				</h3>
				<p>The genre of fairy tales is a wide one, crossing into almost every culture and encompassing
					everything from early oral stories passed down from generation to generation to the more modern
					literary fairy tale. What makes something a fairy tale? While there's a great deal of discussion
					around that question, most have a number of things in common: a series of far-fetched events;
					fantastical beings such as talking animals, elves, goblins, mermaids, witches, and dragons; and
					objects that have magical elements.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">One of the powers of a fairy tale&mdash;or a game set in a fairy tale-inspired
					setting&mdash;is its ability to create a sense of wonder and to evoke players' imaginations while
					still allowing them to keep one foot in the known. The very settings themselves are both enchanted
					and somehow familiar, whether the characters are entering a magical woods, falling down a rabbit
					hole, or embarking on a voyage to Neverland. Those beasts and beings who stalk such places are
					equally wondrous, and offer fantastic starting points for any number of adventures.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">To heighten the sense of wonder in a fairy tale adventure or campaign, a GM
					might consider presenting the game in a modern setting. In a modern setting, characters have regular
					jobs that don't normally involve hunting goblins or helping talking fish solve puzzles. This means
					that when the moths take shape and become the cloak of a princess of summer come to beg a favor or
					steal a child, or the house grows legs and runs away one morning, the player characters will be
					rightfully amazed (and perhaps somewhat terrified).</p>

						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Faerie (also called by many other names) is a dimension of magic separate from but closely parallel
					to the mundane world. It doesn't matter whether Faerie is just a collective term for thousands of
					separate curled-up dimensions hidden in corners, in closets, or at the center of forests, or it's
					one continuous realm that overlaps the real world where it's thinnest. It's a place those with open
					hearts can find by following a way between tall trees (or looming library shelves) to a realm where
					everything is different. Where elves walk, nymphs dance, unicorns gallop, and both natural growths
					and built structures become vast and enchanting.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Humans don't tend to do well in such a world if they stay too long, as the
					sensory input is hard on the nervous system. But fey creatures depend on it, like plants to the
					light. A fey creature too long cut off from its land of origin (or its stream, hill, or burrow)
					slowly becomes mortal and then dies.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When a fey creature is cut by silvered or cold iron weapons, they temporarily
					lose the sustaining benefit of their connection to Faerie. This severed connection usually disrupts
					a fey creature's ability to heal. A silvered weapon is one that contains silver as part of an
					alloying process, has silver inlay, or has been coated in a dusting of silver powder (which usually
					lasts only through a single fight). In truth, many items in the modern era are cold-forged, while
					many others are not. We suggest that any hand-forged item containing iron could be considered a
					cold-forged weapon for harming fey creatures. Thus, most bullets and other modern items wouldn't be
					treated as cold iron by this definition, but some would fit the bill.</p>

						href="#creating-a-historical-adventure" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>One of the draws of playing in a historical adventure is the thrill of "being there" when something
					important happens. Thus, in many cases, historical adventures in RPGs shouldn't be designed as
					campaigns, but instead serve as short-term experiences where players try something new, or at least
					something they don't normally do: play as figures involved in a momentous historical event.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Historical games should take cues from the closely related areas of historical
					fiction and historical re-enactment. The lessons of great historical fiction include the following.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The GM should anchor the characters with problems or conflicts that connect
					them to the chosen time period; make sure that PC backgrounds contain one relevant detail to the
					chosen historical setting.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The GM shouldn't fall into the trap of assuming that history was drab just
					because it is often presented along with old paintings, drawings, or blurred black-and-white
					photographs. Dramatic events, surprising twists, and unexpected situations are just as likely in a
					historical adventure as in any other kind.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">What's the point of a historical adventure if there is no suspense? Sure,
					everyone knows what happens at the end of any given historical battle, but the stories of
					individuals within those fights are not known. Will they live? Will they succeed in their mission?
					And what are the consequences? Think of all the war movies that rely on that exact latitude to tell
					great stories.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Make sure you know when the campaign ends. Maybe it's when the PCs
					successfully accomplish a specific task, but it might be externally timed to when a historical event
					takes place, whether they are attempting to offer aid, thwart it, or merely be aware of it as they
					attempt to do something that history hasn't recorded.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Don't create more than you need to. Be ready to tell the PCs what they see and
					who they encounter when they are introduced to a historical location or person, but don't worry
					about things that they likely will never see. Yes, figure out what kind of currency is used, but
					making a super-accurate list of prices just isn't necessary; the players will take your word for the
					cost of items and many other details. You're evoking a historical setting with your game, not
					writing a book report.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Be wary about stereotypes and cultural misappropriation. History, as they say,
					is written by the victors. The ancient Greeks wrote that other cultures were all barbaric, and the
					European settlers called the natives in North America savages, but that doesn't mean it's true. If
					all you know about a time period is a movie set in that period, you'll have a skewed version of
					events and culture. Be willing to go deeper than Braveheart or The Last Samurai, or maybe choose a
					different genre.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="running-a-historical-game">Running a Historical Game<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#running-a-historical-game" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Preparation is important in a historical game, and most of that entails choosing a historical
					period&mdash;or a specific historical event&mdash;as the setting. Given that all of history can
					serve, you won't lack for resources. Below are a few possibilities. Of course, the farther back you
					set your game, the less information on specific events is available. On the other hand, that frees
					you up to get creative.
				<p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Once you choose the historical period and any special events you want to
					include in your adventure or campaign, direct your players to an appropriate set of foci.
					Alternately, you can have your players play as historically significant figures, but if you do this,
					you may want to create their characters ahead of time. Most GMs will probably want to save
					historically significant individuals for use as NPCs.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The players will need some kind of grounding in what to expect in the time
					period you've chosen. Just like they need an idea of what magic can do in a fantasy game, they will
					need a general idea of what kind of technology is available, the broad strokes of what their
					characters might know and not know, and so on. Maybe have them read a Wikipedia entry, at the very
					least.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you're looking for inspiration for time periods in which to set your
					historical game, here are some possible ideas: prehistory, classical antiquity, ancient Egypt, the
					American revolution, ancient China, World War II, Edo Period Japan, Medieval Europe, and the
					American Old West.</p>

				<p>The concept of artifacts is probably inappropriate for a historical setting without some kind of
					supernatural, fantastical, or science fiction element. That said, objects of mystery such as the
					Antikythera mechanism (an ancient analog computer and orrery used to predict eclipses and other
					astronomical positions) reveal that the ancient world&mdash;and by extension more recent historical
					periods&mdash;contained fascinating and useful objects that were anachronistic for their period.
					Most such artifacts were likely the creations of philosophers, lone geniuses, and similar figures.

				<dl>
					<dt>Level</dt>
					<dd>Like the difficulty of a task, each creature and NPC has a level attached to it. You use the
						level to determine the target number a PC must reach to attack or defend against the opponent.
						In each entry, the difficulty number for the creature or NPC is listed in parentheses after its
						level. As shown on the following table, the target number is three times the level.</dd>
					<dt>Description</dt>
					<dd>Following the name of the creature or NPC is a general description of its appearance, nature,
						intelligence, or background.</dd>
					<dt>Motive</dt>
					<dd>This entry is a way to help the GM understand what a creature or NPC wants. Every creature or
						person wants something, even if it's just to be left alone.</dd>
					<dt>Environment</dt>
					<dd>This entry describes whether the creature tends to be solitary or travel in groups and what kind
						of terrain it inhabits (such as "They travel in packs through dry wastes and temperate
						lowlands").</dd>
					<dt>Health</dt>
					<dd>A creature's target number is usually also its health, which is the amount of damage it can
						sustain before it is dead or incapacitated. For easy reference, the entries always list a
						creature's health, even when it's the normal amount for a creature of its level.</dd>
					<dt>Damage Inflicted</dt>
					<dd>Generally, when creatures hit in combat, they inflict their level in damage regardless of the
						form of attack. Some inflict more or less or have a special modifier to damage. Intelligent NPCs
						often use weapons, but this is more a flavor issue than a mechanical one. In other words, it
						doesn't matter if a level 3 foe uses a sword or claws&mdash;it deals the same damage if it hits.
						The entries always specify the amount of damage inflicted, even if it's the normal amount for a
						creature of its level.</dd>
					<dt>Armor</dt>
					<dd>This is the creature's Armor value. Sometimes the number represents physical armor, and other
						times it represents natural protection. This entry doesn't appear in the game stats if a
						creature has no Armor.</dd>
					<dt>Movement</dt>
					<dd>Movement determines how far the creature can move in a single turn. Creatures have movements of
						immediate, short, long, or very long, which equate to the ranges of the same name. Most PCs have
						an effective movement of short, so if they are chasing (or being chased by) a creature with
						immediate movement, their Speed tasks are eased; if the creature's movement is long or greater,
						the PCs' Speed tasks are hindered.</dd>
					<dt>Modifications</dt>
					<dd>Use these default numbers when a creature's information says to use a different target number.
						For example, a level 4 creature might say "defends as level 5," which means PCs attacking it
						must roll a target number of 15 (for difficulty 5) instead of 12 (for difficulty 4). In special
						circumstances, some creatures have other modifications, but these are almost always specific to
						their level.</dd>
					<dt>Combat</dt>
					<dd>This entry gives advice on using the creature in combat, such as "This creature uses ambushes
						and hit-and-run tactics." At the end of the combat listing, you'll also find any special
						abilities, such as immunities, poisons, and healing skills. GMs should be logical about a
						creature's reaction to a particular action or attack by a PC. For example, a mechanical creation
						is immune to normal diseases, a character can't poison a being of energy (at least, not with a
						conventional poison), and so on.</dd>
					<dt>Interaction</dt>
					<dd>This entry gives advice on using the creature in interactions, such as "These creatures are
						willing to talk but respond poorly to threats," or "This creature is an animal and acts like an
						animal."</dd>
					<dt>Use</dt>
					<dd>This entry gives the GM suggestions for how to use the creature in a game session. It might
						provide general notes or specific adventure ideas.</dd>
					<dt>Loot</dt>
					<dd>This entry indicates what the PCs might gain if they take items from their fallen foes (or trade
						with or trick them). It doesn't appear in the game stats if the creature has no loot.</dd>
					<dt>GM Intrusion</dt>
					<dd>This optional entry in the stats suggests a way to use <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a>
						in an encounter with the creature. It's just one possible idea of many, and the GM is encouraged
						to come up with their own uses of the game mechanic.</dd>

					<p>Unlike many creatures in this chapter, normal animals are simple and understandable enough to be

					<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Bigger and Tougher:</strong> If you need a larger or tougher
						version of a creature, such as a dire wolf or a giant crocodile, you can just increase the
						creature's level (and all of its modifications) by 1 or 2. If the creature has a damage or
						health stat that isn't the default for its level, take that into account at the modified
						creature's new level.</p>
					<p>A simple rule of thumb is to double a creature's size (length, width, and height) for every level
						it increases.</p>

				<p>An abomination is a hideous bestial humanoid covered with thickened plates of scarlet flesh. Their

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Abominations use scavenged weapons to attack prey at range, but

								damage track</a> as the abomination tears off a big piece of flesh and gulps it down.
							Those who survive an attack must succeed on a Might defense task a day later when they come

					</li>

						(15)</span><a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#creature-basilisk" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>A basilisk is a magical kind of serpent that resembles a cobra, has a series of scales on its head
					like a crown, and crawls upright instead of slithering on its belly. It feeds on snakes and other
					creatures smaller than itself, relying on its poisonous aura to weaken and kill its prey. It is
					known to make an unnerving growl instead of a typical snake hiss. An adult basilisk is 10 to 18 feet
					(3 to 5.5 m) long.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Hunger</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Armor:</strong> 1</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Short</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Perception and stealth as level 6</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A basilisk bites like a snake, inflicting 5 points of damage and
							injecting a poison that moves the target one step down <a href="#the-damage-track">the
								damage track</a> if they fail a Might defense roll.</p>
						<p>The basilisk can spit its poison up to short range, inflicting 1 point of damage and moving
							the target one step down the damage track if they fail a Might defense roll.</p>
						<p>The basilisk's venom affects its breath, and on its turn, anything within immediate range of
							it must make a Might defense roll or take 1 point of poison damage. Because of this constant
							invisible cloud of poison, a basilisk's lair is surrounded by a stinking area of dead
							vegetation, blasted earth, and etched stone.</p>
						<p>Basilisk venom is so potent that even creatures that are immune to poison can still be harmed
							by it, taking 5 points of Speed damage instead of moving down the damage track. (A creature
							that is immune to poison and acid is fully immune to the venom.)</p>
						<p>Anyone within short range of a basilisk who meets its gaze and fails a Might defense roll
							turns to stone. In combat, when a character within short distance attacks a basilisk, they
							must either avert their gaze to attack safely (which hinders their attack by two steps) or
							make a Might defense roll. On a failed Might defense roll, the character takes 5 points of
							ambient damage as their flesh partly mineralizes; if the character is killed by this damage,
							they are turned to stone.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Basilisks act like simple animals and respond threateningly if
							disturbed or provoked. If not hungry, a basilisk avoids conflict and hides in its lair.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A blighted area in a field, briar, or forest suggests that a basilisk
							has moved into the area. Swarms of snakes enter a village, fleeing an approaching basilisk.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Loot:</strong> Basilisk venom is valuable, but it must be stored in a strong, sealed
							container or the bearer will succumb to the poison. Its blood has alchemical properties
							relating to transmuting metals.</p>

				<p>Blackguards are evil knights who serve dark entities or their own corrupt agendas. Some were once
					honorable knights who fell to temptation and have abandoned their original principles, but many were
					raised under evil circumstances and have never known anything but hatred and conflict.</p>

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Blackguards use high-quality armor and weapons (usually decorated
							with symbols depicting death, demons, or evil gods). Many wear heavy armor and prefer
							weapons that inflict bleeding wounds, but some take a more subtle approach and act more like
							assassins than knights. A blackguard typically has two or three of the following abilities:
						</p>
						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Fiendish Beast:</em> The blackguard has a companion creature such as a dog, horse,
								or raven with an eerie, unnatural look (in the case of small animals, the creature may
								also be an exceptionally large specimen of its kind). The creature is actually a
								semi-intelligent fiend in animal shape (and therefore immune to abilities that affect
								only normal animals) that can understand the blackguard's commands, and may even be able
								to speak. If the beast is a horse or similar creature, the blackguard might ride it as a
								mount.</li>
							<li><em>Necromancy:</em> The blackguard uses a ten-minute ritual to animate a human-sized
								corpse as a zombie under their control. The zombie becomes a corpse again after a day.
							</li>
							<li><em>Poison:</em> The blackguard coats their weapons with a level 6 poison; a foe who
								fails a Might defense roll moves one step down <a href="#the-damage-track">the damage
									track</a>.</li>
							<li><em>Spells:</em> The blackguard knows several spells granted by an evil entity,
								typically spells that cause a foe to flee in fear for one minute, restore 10 health,
								create an eerie darkness or fog in long range, or grant +5 Armor against energy and
								magical attacks for an hour.</li>
							<li><em>Surprise Attack:</em> When the blackguard attacks from a hidden vantage, with
								surprise, or before their opponent has acted in combat, they get an asset on the attack
								and inflict +4 points of damage. Unholy</li>
							<li><em>Aura:</em> Defense rolls by foes within immediate distance of the blackguard are
								hindered.</li>

				<p>Fine ebony scales cover a cambion's perfectly athletic figure. Two reddish horns grow from its brow,
					and the tips of fangs emerge from between its dusky lips. Its eyes, absent iris and pupil, are the

				<p>Chimeras are unsettling hybrids that combine the features of many different animals, often arranged
					in odd formations. The fusion of animal forms is the only thing that unifies these
					creatures&mdash;otherwise, different chimeras often look very different from each other. They
					include combinations of goat and lion, lizard and bat, dragon and spider, dinosaur and giant insect.
					A few even display human features, such as an improbably located face or hands instead of claws.
					Some chimeras can fly. Others slither across the ground.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A chimera typically has a dominant form to which other animal parts are
					grafted. The base form must be large enough to support the weight of the extra heads, so lions,
					bears, and horses are popular as the base form.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Chimeras kill even when not hungry and throw their victims' remains around a
					wide area in a wild rage. When not feeding or tormenting prey, a chimera that can fly takes to the
					air, beating its enormous leather wings to scour the landscape for new prey.</p>

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> All chimeras have a number of ways to kill. The exact methods vary,
							but most can bite, sting, and gore (three attacks) as a single action, either attacking the
							same opponent or attacking different foes within immediate range of each other. A chimera's
							sting carries a powerful toxin, and a stung target must succeed on a Might defense roll or

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A chronophage attacks with its crushing mandibles.</p>
						<p>A chronophage can phase back and forth between its home dimension, and it uses this ability

							barriers or features of the landscape. It can also use the ability to draw a victim's

							However, it is an action for the creature to shift its phase between the dimension of time

								hour.</li>
							<li><em>Madness:</em> Wracks the brain of one creature within short range for one hour,
								reducing them to a babbling catatonic state in which they can't recognize friend or foe.
								If disturbed or harmed, the creature is likely to lash out with lethal force at what it
								perceives as its tormentors.</li>

							<li><em>Summon Demon:</em> Summons a demon to serve the mage for one hour.</li>
							<li><em>Teleport:</em> Moves the mage up to 100 miles (160 km) away, or less far if they
								bring additional creatures with them.</li>
							<li><em>Twist Flesh:</em> Reshapes the flesh of a creature within close range, turning it
								into a hideous monstrosity for one hour. The transformed creature's actions are
								hindered, but its physical attacks inflict +3 points of damage. The mage's control over
								the creature is limited to indicating which target it should attack.</li>

						<p>A corrupt mage usually has several cyphers useful in combat and perhaps an artifact as well.

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Corrupt mages generally can't be trusted and see other

					scraps of cloth, or canvas stolen during their travels. A cyclops's most distinctive feature is the
					single eye positioned in the center of its forehead. Cyclopes live on the edges of civilized areas
					or on remote islands. For all their power and stature, they aren't especially brave, and most have a

						<p>Cyclopes can pry up boulders from the ground and throw them at targets within long range. A
							thrown boulder inflicts 8 points of damage to all targets in an immediate area.</p>
						<p>Killing a cyclops can be dangerous. When killed, it falls away from the attacker that
							delivered the killing blow. Any creature under it when it falls must make a successful Speed
							defense roll or be pinned under its corpse and take 7 points of damage. Escaping from under
							a dead cyclops requires a successful Might roll.</p>

				<p>Lesser gods, divine children of gods and mortals, and other beings bequeathed with partly divine
					power are called demigods. Their capacities so radically exceed those of regular people that they
					have transcended humanity. Demigods are so physically and mentally powerful that it's difficult for

					effort in the first place.</p>

							destruction if it wishes, so that instead of affecting only one target, a bolt deals 9
							points of damage to all targets within short range of the primary target. Targets caught in
							the conflagration who succeed on a Speed defense roll still suffer 5 points of damage.</p>
						<p>Demigods are just as scary in hand-to-hand combat and can attack all targets within immediate
							range as an action. They can also call on a variety of other abilities that seem like magic
							to lesser foes and mimic the effect of any cypher of level 5 or lower.</p>
						<p>A demigod doesn't need to alter reality to heal itself, as it automatically regains 2 points

					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A demigod was banned from the higher realm of their birth for unknown

						<p>A possessed target is allowed an Intellect defense roll to eject the demon once per day,

				<p>Devils are manifest evil. As "native fauna" of various tortuous nether realms, devils come in many

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Evil, cruel, and malevolent, devils are more than happy to

						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Captivate:</em> A dragon with this ability can psychically mesmerize a nondragon
								target in immediate range who fails an Intellect defense roll. A captivated target does

								a third party about its mental condition, the target is allowed another Intellect
								defense roll to break the effect.</li>
							<li><em>Change Shape:</em> A dragon with this ability can take the form of a human or
								similar humanoid as its action, or return to its regular shape. When so changed, the
								dragon's disguise is nearly impenetrable without special knowledge. As a human, the
								dragon is a level 5 creature.</li>
							<li><em>Fiery Breath:</em> A dragon can breathe a stream of fire up to long range, doing 7
								points of damage to all targets within immediate range of each other. Targets who
								succeed on a Speed defense roll to avoid the full effect of the fire still take 3 points
								of damage. This ability cannot be used in consecutive rounds.</li>

				<p>The grisly sign of an active thorn elemental in areas of heavy woods or jungle is the presence of

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Thorn elementals communicate through speech, though they

				<p>Water elementals are animate masses of water. When swimming, they are nearly indistinguishable from

						<p>Instead of a bashing attack, a water elemental can use its action to attempt to envelop,

							following turn, the enveloped character must attempt a new Might defense roll every round or
							move one step down <a href="#the-damage-track">the damage track</a> from drowning as the
							elemental forces itself into the creature's lungs. The creature can free itself with a Might
							defense roll. An elemental with an enveloped opponent can move up to a short distance as its

						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Water elementals are somewhat intelligent but think very

						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Hundreds of thousands of years ago, enthraller ancestors psychically dominated a group of
					interstellar spacefarers who had the misfortune to land on the enthraller homeworld. Leapfrogging
					technological prowess by mentally commandeering the know-how of every new species they encountered
					using their stolen space vessel, the aliens fashioned the Enthraller Dominion, which stretches
					across vast swaths of space, cemented by the psychic control.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Individual enthrallers are scary, but enthraller overlords are even more
					powerful thanks to technological aids. These include cranial circlets that give a single enthraller
					governor the ability to dominate a small city, solar-system-sized ring relays that boost their
					control across interstellar distances, and more.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Recently, a newly contacted species of aliens developed the technological
					means to resist the mental influence of the enthrallers. Now war bubbles across the Enthraller
					Dominion. Sometimes individual enthrallers, stripped of their technological enhancements as a
					consequence of this war, flee into virgin space, looking for new soldiers to dominate.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Domination of other creatures</p>

						<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Speed defense as level 4; perception and ability to detect
							falsehoods as level 8</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> An enthraller usually relies on dominated minions to make physical
							attacks on its behalf. An enthraller can make a psychic attack on a creature within short
							range. On a failed Intellect defense roll, the target acts as the enthraller mentally
							commands on its next action. If the same target is affected by this dominating attack a
							second time within a minute, the enthraller's mental control lasts for one minute.</p>
						<p>Alternatively, as its action, an enthraller can emit a psychic burst that can target up to
							three creatures in short range. On a failed Intellect defense roll, a victim suffers 4
							points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and is unable to take actions on their subsequent
							turn. If the victim is attacked while so stunned, their defense rolls are hindered by two
							steps.</p>
						<p>The enthraller's attack is a form of mental feeding. If it moves a PC down <a
								href="#the-damage-track">the damage track</a>, the creature regains 4 points of health.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> An enthraller can communicate telepathically with characters
							within short range. It tries to mentally dominate whoever it runs across and will negotiate
							only with characters who are strong enough to harm it. Even if an enthraller makes a deal,
							it eventually reneges if it senses any advantage for doing so because it implicitly believes
							that other creatures are cattle.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A spacecraft (or perhaps an escape pod) crash lands. Inside, a hurt
							enthraller lies in suspended animation. Investigators are unlikely to realize the

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Loot:</strong> Enthrallers wear light armor suited for their forms. They might have

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Evil priests make one or two short-range magical attacks as an
							action, which are thematically appropriate to the god or entity they serve, such as blasts
							of hellfire, grasping shadowy tentacles, or disruptive necromantic energy. They often rely
							on zealous minions to protect them from melee opponents.</p>
						<p>Priests usually know several spells, such as how to banish or control creatures from other
							dimensions, create an area of darkness, see and hear remote locations, speak with the dead,
							mesmerize or paralyze a person, cause blindness, or create a ward against energy damage.
							They also have the following magical abilities:</p>
						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Curse:</em> The priest curses a foe within short range, hindering all of the foe's
								actions by two steps.</li>
							<li><em>Heal:</em> The priest heals a touched creature for 10 health or removes an
								affliction such as a disease or curse.</li>
							<li><em>Necromancy:</em> The priest uses a ten-minute ritual to animate up to four
								human-sized corpses as <a href="#creature-skeleton">skeletons</a> or <a
									href="#creature-zombie">zombies</a> under their control. The undead revert to
								corpses after a day.</li>
							<li><em>Sacrifice:</em> The priest uses a ten-minute ritual to kill a helpless, restrained,
								or unconscious creature of level 4 or higher, using its soul to grant one ally an asset
								on all actions and defenses for one day.</li>
							<li><em>Summon:</em> Once per hour the priest can summon a demon or one level 3 or 4
								creature (such as a giant snake, giant spider, or swarm of bugs). The summoned creature
								serves the priest for an hour before vanishing.</li>
							<li><em>Swarm of bugs:</em> level 3</li>
						</ul>
						<p>An evil priest usually has one or two combat-useful manifest cyphers and often has an
							artifact appropriate to their religion. Most also wear armor or have an ongoing defensive
							spell that grants them Armor.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Evil priests tend to be knowledgeable, arrogant, and
							condescending toward heroes and members of rival faiths. They might strike a bargain to save
							their lives or the life of a valuable minion, or to gain an advantage later on.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> An evil priest is converting frightened peasants into followers, and
							turning those who refuse into zombie slaves. A new religious figure in the city is acting
							suspiciously, and members of rival faiths have been disappearing or turning up dead.</p>
					</li>
					<li>

				<p>Faeries are magic creatures of music, mirth, tricks, and taunts. Some might only perform a silly song

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A faerie can hurl damaging magic dust at any target within short
							range, but sometimes it wields tiny weapons such as bows, spears, or swords.</p>
						<p>If a faerie is touched or struck by a melee weapon, more magic dust puffs away from the
							faerie and clouds the attacker, who must make a Speed defense roll or take the same amount
							of damage they just dealt to the faerie.</p>
						<p>A faerie can see in the dark, but it can also emit bright light and appear as a glowing
							humanoid or an illuminated sphere.</p>
						<p>Faeries regenerate 1 point of health per round while their health is above 0.</p>
						<p>Some faeries can attempt to use a song or light display to charm others within short range.
							The target must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or fall into a suggestible state for
							one hour. During this period, the target can be led by the faerie at their regular movement
							rate. The target can be brought out of the spell early if they take damage or are heartily
							slapped and shaken for a round or two, causing the glamour to fade. A faerie can use this
							power once per minute.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Faeries are mercurial creatures, but except for the malicious

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> At night, a fallen angel can attack other creatures by projecting a

						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> By day, fallen angels are not automatically hostile, and they
							can be negotiated and reasoned with. They can seem truly angelic, though they are often

					those recently interred from their graves, though many prefer to eat from still-living victims.</p>

						<p>On the other hand, golems are activated by light, even light as dim as a candle. In complete
							darkness, a golem is blind and suffers penalties to attack and defend normally. A golem
							subject to complete darkness may choose to freeze in place like a statue. When one does so,
							its Armor increases to 10 (and Armor against ambient damage increases to 5), but it can take
							no actions, including purely mental actions. Unless something can damage the golem through

					with their vanity, they were transformed into hideous monsters. A gorgon has the upper body of a
					human of perfect form and physique, but the lower body of a giant serpent, complete with rattling
					tail. One who dares look at a gorgon's face can see traces of the old beauty beneath a weary veneer,
					darkened by hatred. Instead of hair, serpents crown a gorgon's head, snapping and hissing at anyone
					who draws near. Yet the most terrible aspect of a gorgon is its gaze, which can turn any creature to

							of the action the gorgon uses to attack, the serpents on its head can also attack one target

							(which deals 4 additional points of Speed damage that ignores Armor).</p>
						<p>Anyone within short range of a gorgon who meets its gaze and fails a Might defense roll turns

							avert their gaze (which hinders the attack by two steps) or make a Might defense roll. On a
							failure, they take 5 points of ambient damage as their flesh partly mineralizes. If the
							character is killed by this damage, they are turned to stone.</p>
						<p>Some gorgons carry a couple of cyphers and perhaps an artifact that they can use in combat.

				<p>Greys are enigmatic creatures born of alien stars (or dimensions) who have learned to move across the
					vast distances that bridge neighboring star systems. The creatures descend through the atmosphere
					under the cover of night to abduct specimens for study and return the victims later after a thorough
					examination. Returned abductees are usually befuddled and confused, and they retain little memory of
					what happened to them. Victims of the greys' examination frequently sport strange marks on their
					flesh, oddly shaped wounds, gaps where teeth used to be, and strange or unknown metal lodged
					somewhere under the skin.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A grey stands 3 feet (1 m) tall. It has a narrow body with skinny limbs and a
					large, bulbous head. Two large black eyes, almond shaped, dominate a face that has only a suggestion
					of a nose and a narrow mouth. Greys wear skintight uniforms, carry numerous instruments to study
					their environments, and keep a weapon or two for protection.</p>

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A grey carries a powerful ray emitter that can burn holes through
							solid steel. The grey can use the emitter to attack targets within long range. Against
							dangerous opponents, a grey can use an action to activate a personal shield that
							encapsulates it in a bubble of force. The shield gives it +3 to Armor, but while the shield
							is active, the grey can't fire its ray emitter.</p>
						<p>Greys are scientists, but cautious ones. Leaving a trail of corpses as evidence of their
							existence isn't their preferred mode of operation. For this reason, one grey in every group
							has a memory eraser. When this grey activates the device, each target other than a grey
							within short range must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or become stunned for one
							minute, taking no action (unless attacked, which snaps the victim out of the condition).
							When the effect wears off naturally, the target has no recollection of encountering little

						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Greys are curious about the places they visit but reluctant to

				<p>Hags are evil magical creatures distantly related to the fey. They resemble withered ancient humans

							of the following abilities:</p>
						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Arcane blast:</em> Use magical energy to blast one foe within short range and
								inflict 6 points of damage, or divide this energy (and damage) among several foes as the

							<li><em>Change shape:</em> Transform into a humanoid or common animal, or return to their

								two steps.</li>
							<li><em>Fear:</em> Terrify all creatures within short range who look upon them, causing the
								creatures to flee for one minute if they fail an Intellect defense roll.</li>
							<li><em>Illusion:</em> Create an illusion affecting a small area that includes light, sound,
								and smell. They can use this to disguise themselves as any humanoid creature (such as a
								human, dwarf, or elf). Changing or maintaining the illusion is not an action.</li>
							<li><em>Invisibility:</em> Turn invisible for ten minutes. When invisible, they are
								specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks.</li>
							<li><em>Murderous glare:</em> Glare at one opponent, causing bloody wounds that inflict 6
								points of damage if the creature is within short range (3 points if within long range).
							</li>
							<li><em>Question:</em> Get an answer to a very simple, general question about a creature or
								place within 1 mile (1.5 km).</li>
							<li><em>Scrying eye:</em> View any familiar location within 1 mile as if they were observing
								it directly.</li>
							<li><em>Sleep:</em> Make a creature fall asleep for one minute. Damage or loud noises will
								wake the creature.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Three or more allied hags form a coven, which allows them to use each other's magical
							abilities, and usually grants the coven (when working together) one or two additional
							abilities.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Hags are evil, greedy, hateful, and cruel. They rarely do
							things for others unless they benefit in some way, and they like to trick fools into

							respect and bribed or paid, a hag can be a valuable source of lore.</p>

				<p>A harpy is a hideous, filthy creature with the body of a large vulture and the neck and head of an
					ugly human. Their breath reeks of decay, their wings and talons drip with an unpleasant oil, and
					their eyes shed acrid tears. They love to torment people and lure them to their deaths.</p>

						<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Perception and Speed defense as level 4</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Harpies are fast and strong, capable of carrying off a light adult
							human. They attack with their long talons.</p>
						<p>Anything a harpy touches becomes fouled with their smelly fluids, and one harpy energetically
							flapping their wings is enough to contaminate an immediate area. Their fluids are repulsive
							but not directly harmful, and the smell persists even after a casual washing. Any food
							touched by harpy filth is inedible to anyone but a harpy. Creatures with a sensitive sense
							of smell (such as dogs and wolves) are hindered when within a short distance of a harpy. It
							is common for a group of harpies to attack a campsite or festival, spread their stink over
							everything, and fly away with whatever food they can carry.</p>
						<p>A harpy can sing a weird, entrancing song that hypnotizes whoever hears it. Anyone within
							long range who hears the song must make an Intellect defense roll or stop whatever they are
							doing and attempt to approach the harpy. If the creature comes within an immediate distance
							of a singing harpy, they stand there dumbly even as the harpy attacks them. The creature can
							make another attempt to break free each round on its turn, and taking damage from anything
							other than a singing harpy allows them another attempt to break free. Five or more harpies
							can work together on the same song (treat as a level 5 effect). Harpies are cruel and have
							been known to lead an entranced creature into a pit, off a cliff, or over the railing of a
							ship.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Other than their singing, harpies do not usually speak with

						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A flock of harpies torments a village during its harvest festival,

				<p>In haunted castles and among the armies mustered by those with power over life and death, sometimes
					walk hollow knights. These animated suits of armor move just like living people, and many who
					encounter these dread revenants mistake them for living foes only to realize in horror that there's
					nothing inside except for the memory of the warrior that once donned the suit. Brought into being by
					binding the spirit of a dead warrior to its panoply, hollow knights behave in much the same way they
					did in life&mdash;disciplined, loyal, and battle ready. Clad head to toe in full plate armor, with
					battered shields strapped to their arms and rusty swords gripped in lobster gauntlets, the knights
					stand ready to face any foe, heedless of the danger, driven to serve the necromancer that made them.
					Hollow knights might ride on the backs of skeletal steeds and wield lances.</p>

						<p>When mounted on a steed, a hollow knight charges its enemies whenever possible. As an action,

							point during this movement. When attacking in this way, the knight inflicts 7 points of
							damage.</p>
						<p>A hollow knight is fearless and fights until destroyed or ordered to pull back. The magic
							animating its armor is slow to fade, so armor components may continue to twitch and jerk
							even after the knight has fallen. Usually, when defeated, the suit of armor falls apart, and
							wisps of grey smoke curl up from the remains.</p>

				<p>This mythological reptile has five writhing serpent heads, each of which constantly exhales a
					venomous plume. Well over 20 feet (6 m) long from the tip of its longest head to its thrashing tail,
					the toxic beast's most discomfiting feature is its magical ability to sprout new heads when it's
					wounded. Some hydras dwell on land, others in water. Most seem to have been set as guardians of

							must succeed on a Might defense task or take 1 point of Speed damage (ignores Armor).</p>
						<p>All five of a hydra's heads can simultaneously bite foes in immediate range. If three or more
							heads coordinate their attack, the heads make one attack as a single level 9 creature
							dealing 9 points of damage. A target bitten by the venomous hydra must also succeed on a
							Might defense task or take an additional 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).</p>
						<p>Whenever the hydra takes 4 or more points of damage from a single attack, a healing pulse
							surges through the creature a round later. The pulse returns the health just subtracted due
							to the attack and triggers the immediate growth of two additional heads that sprout from the
							creature. (The same thing happens if one of the creature's snakelike heads is decapitated.)

					Appearances of these colossal creatures are rare events that usually don't last for more than a few
					days. In that sense, they're akin to hundred-year storms and at least as destructive. When they
					emerge, they're attracted by artificial structures, the more densely situated and elaborate the
					better, which they set to smashing with a vengeance. It's hard to judge the size of things so far
					outside normal scale, but good estimates put most kaiju at over 300 feet (90 m) in height.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Kaiju rely primarily on their strength and mass, but many have some additional
					trick or ability that sets them apart from their kin, which usually translates into even more
					devastation.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The other quality all kaiju share is the talent of hiding after a rampage by
					diving into a nearby sea or burrowing deep into the earth. Sometimes the same kaiju will appear
					again days, months, years, or decades later, attacking the same location or someplace entirely new.

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A kaiju can punch, kick, or deliver a tail or tentacle lash at

							damage.</p>
						<p>Kaiju heal quickly, usually at a rate of 2 points per round.</p>
						<p>Kaiju are rare and devastating enough that most are dubbed with a unique identifier by
							survivors. The entry for each creature below notes only where it varies from the base
							creature described above.</p>
						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Rampagion:</em> This kaiju has been estimated to be almost 1,000 feet (300 m) high.
								Once per day, it can make a charging trample attack, dealing its damage in a line 300
								feet (90 m) wide and 2 miles (3 km) long. Rampagion has 10 Armor and deals 20 points of
								damage with a physical attack (or 8 points if a victim makes a successful Speed defense
								roll).</li>
							<li><em>Suneko:</em> This kaiju's body, which resembles a cross between a lion and a lizard,
								is so hot that its skin glows like red coals, its mane like the sun's corona, and its
								eyes like beaming searchlights. Suneko automatically deals 10 points of damage to
								everyone within immediate range. The creature can emit twin rays of plasma from its eyes
								in a focused beam that can reach as far as the horizon, which from Suneko's height above
								the ground is about 22 miles (35 km). When it makes its eyebeam attack, it stops
								emitting killing heat in immediate range for about one minute.</li>

						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Most PCs can't directly interact with a kaiju unless they have

						href="#creature-killing-white-light" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>A killing white light isn't a subtle hunter. At a distance, the creature is an eye-watering point of
					brilliance. When it closes in, it is nothing less than blinding, though its emanation isn't warm.
					Despite the blazing intensity, a killing white light is as cold as starlight on a December night,
					sapping heat and life from living things caught in its radiance.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">By day, a killing white light is usually inactive. During this period, the
					creature hibernates in darkened areas, as if unwilling or unable to compete against the sun.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Eliminate organic life</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> An active (glowing) killing white light can attack one target within
							immediate range each round with a pulse of its brilliant nimbus. A character who fails a
							Speed defense roll against the attack takes damage and experiences a cooling numbness. A
							victim killed by the creature is rendered into so much blowing ash, though their clothing
							and equipment are unharmed.</p>
						<p>As it attacks, a killing white light emits a blinding nimbus of illumination that affects all
							creatures within short range. Targets in the area must succeed on a Might defense roll each
							round or be blinded for one round. A character in the area can avert their eyes when
							fighting a killing white light to avoid being blinded, but attacks and defenses are hindered
							for those who do so.</p>
						<p>A killing white light is vulnerable to strong sources of light other than its own. If exposed
							to daylight or caught in a high-intensity beam of light (such as a spotlight), the killing
							white light falters and takes no action for one round, after which it can act normally.
							However, if the competing light persists for more than three or four rounds, the creature
							usually retreats to a darkened place of safety.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> A killing white light is too alien for interaction and may not
							be intelligent in a way humans can understand.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> An inactive killing white light (which looks something like an albino
							lump of volcanic glass) is sometimes mistaken for a cypher whose properties can't quite be

						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>A lich is a powerful wizard or priest who has used their knowledge of necromancy to bind their soul
					in a magical object called a phylactery, making them immortal and undead unless their soul object is
					found and destroyed. Having corrupted its own life energy in an obscene ritual, a lich can pursue
					its other magical goals, usually the acquisition of more wealth, magic, and power. A newly made lich
					may look like a recent corpse, but maintaining its physical vessel becomes less of a priority as the
					centuries pass, so over time they tend to look withered or even skeletal. Liches often work with or
					command other undead, such as <a href="#creature-wraith">wraiths</a>, <a
						href="#creature-skeleton">skeletons</a>, <a href="#creature-vampire">vampires</a>, and <a
						href="#creature-zombie">zombies</a>.</p>

					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A lich can shoot blasts of necromantic energy that inflict 8 points
							of damage on a target and 4 points on any creature within immediate range of the target. A
							lich knows many spells, such as the following:</p>
						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Animate guards:</em> Animate ten corpses as skeletons or zombies, which obey the
								lich for one hour before turning back into corpses.</li>
							<li><em>Armor:</em> Gain +5 Armor for one hour.</li>
							<li><em>Death:</em> Inflict 8 points of damage on a creature within short range; if the
								creature fails a Might defense roll, it also moves two steps down <a
									href="#the-damage-track">the damage track</a>.</li>
							<li><em>Fly:</em> For one hour, move through the air as effortlessly as walking.</li>
							<li><em>Paralyze:</em> One target within short range is held motionless for two rounds,
								unable to take any physical actions.</li>
							<li><em>Polymorph:</em> Transform a creature within short range into a harmless creature
								like a fish or frog for one minute.</li>
							<li><em>Scrying eye:</em> View any familiar location within 1 mile (1.5 km) as if the lich
								was observing it directly.</li>
							<li><em>Teleport:</em> Move instantly up to 1 mile. A lich also likely carries several
								cyphers useful in combat. Liches are undead, and therefore immune to anything that
								affects only living creatures, such as disease and poison. Unless its well-hidden
								phylactery is destroyed, a lich that is killed reforms a new body near its phylactery
								over the next week or so, returning at full health and with all of its abilities and
								memories.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Liches hate being interrupted and have more important things to
							do than answer questions from mortal weaklings. A lich may be convinced to teach a character
							a spell, especially if given a spell, cypher, or artifact in trade.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A lich is planning a ritual to raise an army of skeletons or zombies to
							attack the kingdom. A lich has made a pact with a demon to unleash a plague in exchange for
							obscure magical knowledge.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Loot:</strong> A lich has 1d6 cyphers and usually an artifact.</p>

						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>A manticore is a fearsome predator that resembles a maned red lion with a human head and a scorpion's
					tail. The head is bearded and has three rows of teeth in the upper and lower jaws, like a shark. The
					scorpion tail is covered in multiple barbs, and the creature can flick its tail to hurl these barbs
					at its prey. Manticores eat all of their prey, including the bones, clothing, and equipment, leaving
					nothing but a bloodstain as evidence of their hunting.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Manticores attack with their powerful bite, seeking to incapacitate
							or kill one opponent quickly so they can eat. Some are content to attack and consume a
							single target, but a large, hungry manticore prefers to wait until two or three creatures
							are nearby before attacking. A manticore has powerful legs and can leap up to a short
							distance in any direction, and often surprises its prey by leaping from concealment.</p>
						<p>Instead of biting, a manticore can use its poisonous scorpion-like tail to strike one
							creature in melee with a cluster of barbs, inflicting 4 points of damage (plus 4 additional
							points of Speed damage if the target fails a Might defense roll). With a flick of its tail,
							it can hurl up to four barbs up to a short distance away, striking one or more creatures in
							an immediate area. Each barb inflicts 1 point of damage, and the target must succeed on a
							Might defense roll or take 1 additional point of Speed damage.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Manticores can make trumpet-like noises that resemble speech,
							but this seems to be a trick to lure prey. Most of them are not intelligent enough to know

					land-walking species interact only with the common or soldier merfolk who visit the ocean surface
					and coastlines. Merfolk societies are much like those of surface humans; their inability to use fire
					limits them in some ways (such as blacksmithing), but they have compensated for this with water
					magic and other skills.</p>
				<p>Merfolk skin ranges from all human colors to green, blue, and grey. Some have small fins on their
					heads and elbows or webs between their fingers. They dress for comfort and wear jewelry made of
					shells, coral, pearls, polished gemstones, and metals they can salvage or trade for. Most of them
					are content to be hunters or cultivators of kelp and other aquatic plants, but some are curious

						<p>About once every ten minutes, a merperson can swim a short distance as their action and still
							make a melee attack, or swim up to a long distance as their action.</p>
						<p>About one in ten merfolk have the magical ability to harden water until it is as strong and
							durable as wood, taking about an hour to make a spear or similar tool that lasts for several

				<p>Minotaurs are aggressive bull-humanoids who enjoy human flesh. Some legends say the first minotaur
					was the result of a curse from a god, and others suggest it was created by a demon, but the truth is
					lost to antiquity. Minotaurs care little about history or their origin, preferring to hunt for meat
					and spar with each other for dominance and trophies. Minotaurs live in small tribes of up to a dozen
					adults. Solitary minotaurs are exiles, last survivors of their tribe, or younger individuals
					claiming their own territory.</p>

							can charge up to a short distance and then make an attack, which inflicts an additional 3
							points of damage.</p>
						<p>Minotaurs are interested in mazes and mazelike spaces and like to wander within them,
							memorizing the paths and finding good places to stage ambushes. They leave out piles of
							equipment and useless treasures from previous victims to lure people into the maze and give
							the minotaur time to corner their prey. Sometimes one minotaur in a tribe develops simple
							magic powers and is able to create illusions of smoke or mist in an area a short distance
							across, turn invisible for a few moments, or enchant weapons to inflict bleeding wounds.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Minotaurs can speak, usually in their own language or another
							crude humanoid language. However, they typically choose not to speak to weaker creatures
							(such as humans).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A wandering gang of minotaurs has been stealing livestock from a local

						<p><strong>Loot:</strong> Minotaurs don't have much use for coins but keep a few small trophies,

						(9)</span><a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#creature-mokuren" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Mokuren are usually no larger than a cat, but they possess the ability to swell until they're the
					size of a bus (if only briefly). That ability, combined with their flashy pyrokinetic tails, make
					these creatures a particular favorite with children, at least in stories and picture books. Given
					that mokuren can "burrow" into paintings and other two-dimensional art, it's possible that some
					mokuren images are more than simple representations.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Play</p>

						<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Defends as level 5 due to size, unless enlarged; see Combat
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A mokuren exists in three states: as an image, as a cat-sized
							creature, and as a bus-sized behemoth.</p>
						<p>As an image, a mokuren can't be harmed. Even if the image is defaced, the mokuren merely
							"burrows" away and reappears like graffiti on a new flat space within a few miles.</p>
						<p>Alternatively, it could emerge from the image and become a physical cat-sized creature as a
							move. In this form, a mokuren can attack with its claws or bite. It can also direct a stream
							of fire from its glowing tail at a target within long range. (When a mokuren flies, it's by
							using its tail to create a jet that rockets it skyward.)</p>
						<p>Finally, it can make an enlarged attack, in which it swells to the size of a bus and swipes
							at, bites, or lands on a target as part of the same action. When enlarged, the mokuren gains
							+5 to Armor and makes and defends against all attacks as a level 7 creature. On a hit, the
							enlarged mokuren deals 7 points of damage. However, a mokuren can remain enlarged for a
							total of only four rounds during any twenty-four-hour period, so it uses this ability
							sparingly or only when enraged.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> To see an active mokuren is considered good luck, unless you
							manage to get on the wrong side of one. Then an offering of sweets must be made to the
							offended creature. A mokuren can't talk, but it can understand the languages where it lives
							about as well as a trained courser or hound can.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A mokuren can lead characters into unexplored areas, helping them find
							places they may have overlooked or skipped. It can also lead PCs into danger, but it usually
							does so only to bring aid (the characters) to someone else in trouble.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>GM intrusion:</strong> The character hit by the mokuren doesn't take damage. Instead,
						they must succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled into the nearest wall, floor, or book
						with the creature, becoming a two-dimensional image. In this state, the victim is in stasis
						until the mokuren pulls them free, another creature "pries" them loose, or a day passes and the

				<p>Morlocks are degenerate, blind cannibal humanoids that avoid light. They have prominent teeth,
					piglike eyes, loose skin, and stooped postures. They avoid bright daylight and prefer to hunt and
					forage when it is dark out (or at least under the twilight-like canopy of a heavy forest). Morlocks
					eat any sort of meat, even carrion and their own dead. Morlocks build piles of stones to mark their
					territory. On nights of the new moon, they create unnerving music by playing simple drums made out
					of skulls and logs. They lack the foresight to store food for lean times, so they range farther from
					home in winter and times of famine. They are sometimes enslaved by more powerful creatures such as
					ogres or a vampire.</p>

							humanoids doing so. Some tribes dig simple pit traps and chase prey into them.</p>
						<p>Morlocks dislike strong light but are not harmed by it. Their hearing and sense of smell is
							strong enough that they can "see" in dim or very dim light as if it were normal light. They
							can track scents as well as a trained dog.</p>

						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Morlocks have a simple language of hoots, howls, and growls

							<li><em>Regeneration.</em> The noble knight regenerates 2 points of health per round while

				<p>Born into squalor and fear, the orc species is composed of miserable, misbegotten humanoids that seem
					destined to serve as fodder for more powerful evil overlords. When left to their own devices, these
					loathsome creatures turn on each other, the strongest oppressing the next weakest (and so on down
					the line) with cruel barbs, gruesome jokes, and physical beatings. When these creatures have no
					masters to hate, they hate themselves.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">No two orcs look exactly alike, but all have a mean, ugly, and shambolic
					facade. Never clean and often spattered with the remains of recent meals, orcs have a mouthful of
					sharp, broken teeth that can develop into true fangs. Adults range in height from no larger than a
					human child to massive specimens larger than a strapping man. Whether big or small, nearly all orcs
					have stooped backs and crooked legs. The hue of their skin is hard to ascertain, because they are
					covered by the sediment of years, not to mention the iron armor every orc constantly wears from the
					moment it's able to lift a weapon.</p>

							behind the target and try to skewer them through the head or neck with the spike. If a
							target is killed by these attacks, the puppet tree controls the body as a corpse puppet,
							using it to enact its plans. Over time these humanoids rot and are overgrown by the biology
							of the plant, losing utility for the tree. Most trees have about five corpse puppets active,
							which can be simultaneously animated to attack foes.</p>
						<p>A puppet tree is vulnerable to fire. All fire attacks against the tree inflict 2 additional
							points of damage and ignore Armor. The puppet tree will always attempt to stop a fire, or
							target the source of flame during combat.</p>
						<p>A corpse puppet can be detached and sent roaming; however, it retains only about a day's

				<p>A ravage bear is a hideous predator that hunts entirely by sense of smell. It is blind and nearly

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A ravage bear grabs foes with its powerful arms, holds them fast,
							and then squeezes and tears at them until they are dead. It can hold only one creature at a
							time. While a ravage bear is holding a creature, it can attack only the held creature. In
							each round that a held creature does not escape, it suffers 4 points of damage in addition
							to damage from attacks made against it.</p>
						<p>A ravage bear can move very quickly in short sprints. In combat, it can go into an insane

				<p>Virtually identical to adult humans, these biosculpted androids are stronger, faster, and potentially

					true human emotion, be that love, sadness, or empathy, though those who live long enough to lay down
					their own memories can develop the capacity to do so.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">However, few replicants gain the opportunity because they are created for a
					purpose, which could be to serve as police or guards, as soldiers in a distant war, or as impostors
					shaped to blend in with people so they can explore on behalf of an alien intelligence or a
					bootstrapped AI. In most of these cases, these purposes lead to a relatively short span of
					existence, which usually ends when the replicant chooses to detonate itself rather than be captured.

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Replicants blend in and prefer not to enter combat. Since
							destruction is not usually their principal goal, they avoid confrontation. If, however,
							something threatens their mission, they defend themselves to the best of their ability.
							Replicants might use weaponry but are adept in using their limbs to batter foes into
							submission.</p>
						<p>A replicant poses the greatest danger when its physical form begins to fail through violence
							or natural degradation (many seem to have a natural "life" span of just a few years). When
							reduced to 0 points of health, the replicant explodes, inflicting 10 points of damage to
							everything in long range.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Replicants are designed to look human and, at least during a

				<p>Guardians of the wood, sapient trees stand eternally vigilant, often on the outskirts of their grove

					They look like normal trees until they reveal their true nature, with limb-like branches and faces
					in the bark of their trunk. They don't always move, but with effort, they can uproot themselves and
					walk about. However, they usually do so only when no one is looking. The origin and temperament of
					sapient trees varies; they might be haunted trees possessed by spirits, trees animated by magic
					spells, or ancient mythical beings. Some are peaceful and noble, but others are downright wicked and

						<p>If a tree strikes in combat with one of its branch-arms, it can choose to grab the foe
							(rather than inflict damage) and toss them an immediate distance away, inflicting 2 points

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Sapient trees are generally unfriendly and indignant toward

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Shadows attack with their claws, which feel like a cold breeze and
							drain 2 points of Might from their target with each hit. They can barely interact with
							physical objects, and even something as simple as moving a pebble an immediate distance or
							knocking over a candle takes intense concentration.</p>
						<p>A group of five shadows can act as a swarm, focusing on one target to make one attack as a
							single level 3 creature, inflicting 4 points of damage. In an area of complete darkness with
							no illumination at all, shadows are effectively powerless&mdash;they cannot attack and all
							their actions are hindered. If suddenly deprived of light, they slink about menacingly for a
							few minutes but lose interest if it seems like their prey won't be bringing back the light.
						</p>
						<p>Shadows are flat rather than insubstantial, but attacks that harm phased, ghostly, or similar
							creatures are fully effective against them. They can easily pass through narrow spaces such
							as the gap under a door or between the bars of a cell, but cannot move through solid

				<p>Elves who faded from the surface to escape the justice of their fey cousins for crimes uncounted are
					sometimes called shadow elves, dark elves, or simply trow. It's widely assumed that shadow elves
					fled to new realms deep below the ground, and indeed, the routes that lead to their true abodes are
					mostly subterranean and include many grand underground keeps. However, the heart of the shadow elf
					kingdom lies in the colorless dimension of Shadow itself, where all things exist as a dim reflection
					of the real world.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Sometimes shadow elves appear on the surface, spilling from dark tunnels or,
					in some cases, from the shadows themselves. They raid for plunder, fresh slaves, and sacrifices. The
					sacrifices are made to their godqueen, a monstrously sized black widow spider that schemes in
					darkness.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When a shadow elf returns to the world of light, it can choose to appear as a

				<p>Skeletons are animated bones without much sense of self-preservation. They enjoy a crucial advantage

						be prevented if the linchpin of the animating curse is separated from the skeleton after it

				<p>A soul eater is the animate head of a powerful wizard who shuffled off this mortal coil to become an
					undead creature without ethics, feelings, or a sense of morality. Also called dread skulls, these
					creatures maintain their existence by occasionally absorbing the spirit or mind of living victims.
					An absorbed "soul" is burned away, which is why dread skulls are wreathed in flame; it's the
					by-product of the creature's previous meal.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A soul eater has a library of magic abilities it can draw upon,
							including long-range attacks of fire or cold against all targets within immediate range of
							each other, the ability to read the mind of a victim within short range on a failed
							Intellect defense roll, and the ability to cloak itself in the illusion of a normal human
							for up to an hour at a time.</p>
						<p>In addition, a dread skull can draw out a victim's consciousness and absorb it in a blaze of
							supernatural fire. To do so, the creature must bite a target, which inflicts 5 points of
							damage; the target must then succeed on an Intellect defense roll or take an additional 5
							points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).</p>
						<p>If a dread skull drains a character's Intellect Pool to 0 through repeated bites, the
							character's soul is sucked into the skull, and the body falls limp. Once absorbed into the
							skull, a victim's essence is trapped and slowly consumed over the next twenty-four hours.
							During this period, the skull regenerates 1 point of health per round.</p>
						<p>If a dread skull isn't destroyed within twenty-four hours of eating a soul, the victim's
							essence is fully consumed. If the soul eater is defeated and its skull is shattered before
							then, all unconsumed souls are returned to their bodies.</p>

				<p>A sphinx is a magical creature with a large lionlike body, feathered wings, and a head that is like

								make a <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a> that does not count toward their
								normal allotment. Can be used three times per day.</li>
							<li><em>Riddle:</em> A creature within long range must make an Intellect defense roll to
								answer a difficult riddle; failure means the creature stands confused for one minute
								even if they are attacked.</li>
							<li><em>Spellbreaker:</em> End an ongoing magical effect within short range, such as a curse
								or protective spell. If there are multiple effects, the sphinx chooses which one to end.
								It can target an immediate area instead of a specific effect (such as an area where it
								suspects an invisible enemy is hiding).</li>
							<li><em>Teleport:</em> Instantaneously move a very long distance. Can be used once per day.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Sphinxes are very intelligent and speak several languages

				<p>Towering statues carved from stone or cast in metal are sometimes more than humans rendered in

				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Most animate statues are vessels imprisoning the mind of a sentient creature.
					Such entrapment usually tumbles the spirits into the abyss of insanity, though most rest in a

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> An animate statue towers over most foes, and it can smash or stomp a
							target within short range as a melee attack. The statue's massive size and the material of
							its body means it can walk through nearly any obstacle, smashing through walls of solid
							rock, buildings, and trees. When walking, it pays no attention to what it steps on. Anything
							in its path is likely flattened. A character who is stepped on must make a Speed defense
							roll to dodge or be knocked down and take 9 points of damage.</p>
						<p>Animate statues are strong and hard to hurt, but they are often top-heavy. If one falls or is
							knocked over, it takes a few rounds to rise and resume whatever it was doing.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Statues spend years immobilized and insensate, their minds lost
							in half-remembered experiences and hallucinations. Rousing a statue has unpredictable
							results. Some might rampage. Others laugh, cry, or scream streams of nonsense. Regardless,
							if one has been commanded to guard an area or entrance, it also likely lashes out.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> An animate statue holds a treasure trove of knowledge. If the

				<p>A troll is a hideous humanoid standing at least 10 feet (3 m) tall that hunts more by smell than by

						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> The troll attacks with its claws. If it hits, it grabs a foe

							points of damage.</p>
						<p>Trolls regain 3 points of health per round. If a troll suffers a particularly egregious wound
							(10 or more points of damage in one round), rather than regain health in that round (and
							instead of taking any other action), the troll divides into two level 4 trolls that are 3
							feet (1 m) tall. Spawned trolls that survive the battle and have access to food grow into
							full-power trolls within a few weeks.</p>

				<p>The short arms of a tyrannosaurus have been much parodied in Earth social media circles, but the arms
					aren't really important when a hunting tyrannosaurus is after you. It's more the soul-shivering
					roar, designed to freeze prey in place, and a skull and mouth so enormous that the entire creature
					is cantilevered by a massive tail that itself can be used as a powerful weapon.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As vicious as tyrannosauruses likely were 66 million years ago, the versions
					still hunting today could be even more dangerous. That's because the ones with a taste for humans
					have learned to adapt to human defenses and to use their roar to terrorize prey as they hunt.</p>

					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A tyrannosaurus attacks with its massive bite. Not only does it deal
							damage, but the target must also make a Might defense roll to pull free or be shaken like a
							rat in the mouth of a pit bull for 3 additional points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). The
							shaking recurs each subsequent round in which the target fails a Might-based task to pull
							free.</p>
						<p>A tyrannosaurus can also make a trampling attack if it can charge from just outside of short
							range. When it does, it moves 50 feet (15 m) in a round, and anything that comes within
							immediate range is attacked. Even those who make a successful Speed defense roll take 2
							points of damage.</p>
						<p>Finally, a tyrannosaurus can roar. The first time creatures within short range hear the roar
							on any given day, they must succeed on a difficulty 2 Intellect defense roll or stand frozen
							in fear for a round. Attacks against them are eased by two steps in the attacker's favor and
							deal 2 additional points of damage.</p>
						<p>For all their power, tyrannosauruses are not above self-preservation. They never fight to the

				<p>Vampires are undead creatures, risen from the grave to drink blood. Their very nature and essence are

					frequently toy with their prey before feeding. Vampires come out only at night, as the sun's rays
					will destroy them.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The bite of a vampire over three nights (in which it exchanges a bit of its
					own blood) ensures that the victim will rise as a vampire under the thrall of the one that killed

							abilities except that, as a bat, it can fly. Vampires can also transform into shadow or
							mist, and in these forms they can't be harmed by anything (but also can't affect the
							physical world).</p>
						<p>Vampires possess an unholy charisma and can mesmerize victims within immediate distance so
							that they stand motionless for one round. In subsequent rounds, the victim will not forcibly
							resist the vampire, and the vampire can suggest actions to the victim (even actions that
							will cause the victim to harm themselves or others they care about). Each round, the victim
							can attempt a new Intellect defense roll to break free.</p>
						<p>Vampires are notoriously difficult to hurt. Unless a weapon is very special (blessed by a
							saint, has specific magical enchantments against vampires, or the like), no physical attack
							harms a vampire. They simply don't take the damage. Exceptions include the following:</p>
						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Fire:</em> Vampires burn, though the damage doesn't kill them. It only causes pain,
								and a vampire regains all health lost to fire damage within a day.</li>
							<li><em>Running water:</em> Complete immersion inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If
								not destroyed, the vampire can use a single action to regain all health lost in this
								way.</li>
							<li><em>Holy water:</em> This inflicts 4 points of damage and affects a vampire exactly like
								fire.</li>
							<li><em>Sunlight:</em> Exposure to sunlight inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not
								destroyed, the vampire regains all health lost to exposure within a day.</li>
							<li><em>Wooden stake:</em> This weapon inflicts 25 points of damage, effectively destroying
								the vampire in one blow. However, if the vampire is aware and able to move, this attack
								is hindered as the vampire does everything it can to evade.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Further, vampires have the following special weaknesses:</p>
						<ul class="og-csrd-list-disc">
							<li><em>Garlic:</em> Significant amounts of garlic within immediate distance hinder a
								vampire's tasks.</li>
							<li><em>Cross, holy symbol, or mirror:</em> Presenting any of these objects forcefully stuns
								a vampire, causing it to lose its next action. While the object is brandished and the
								vampire is within immediate range, its tasks are hindered by two steps.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Eventually, a vampire with a multitude under its command becomes the new vampire lord. The
							vampire lord is the most powerful vampire in the world and is often (but not always) the
							most ancient of its kind. It has many vampires under its control, and even those that it did
							not create pay it respect and homage.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Most vampires look upon humans as cattle upon which to feed.
							They rarely have respect for anything but other vampires, and they often hate other
							supernatural creatures that they cannot enslave.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> Strange stories of shadows in the night, people disappearing from their
							beds, and graves missing their former occupants could portend the arrival of a vampire in

				<p>When humans are "visited upon" (bitten) by a vampire, they might be killed, or they might be left
					alive to begin a slow transformation into a creature of the night. If victims are bitten three
					times, they become a vampire forever under the control of the one that bit them. From the time of
					the first bite until their complete transformation after the third bite, they are transitional
					vampires. Ways to return transitional vampires to normal include using special ancient rituals or
					destroying the vampire that bit them in the first place.</p>

					slush of salty ooze. Individually the grubs are harmless vermin, but together they're a sentient
					entity, a single psionic mind formed of thousands of tiny, maggot-like pupae. The tightly wound
					leather straps covering a worm that walks are just as important for hiding its true nature as for
					adhesion. Despite being fully encased, the worm that walks senses its environment with a
					hard-to-fool sixth sense.</p>

					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A worm that walks can strike a single target in immediate range with
							a leather-wrapped "fist" as its action. When it hits and deals damage, several grubs spill
							out and attach to the victim (getting under most armor unless it's hermetically sealed or
							behind a force field), who must make a Might defense roll to shake them loose. On a failure,
							the grubs begin to feed, and the target takes 5 points of damage (ignores Armor).</p>
						<p>If a victim is killed while in immediate range of a worm that walks, the worms automatically
							engulf the body through a wide opening in their wrappings. The grubs go into a feeding
							frenzy, reducing the remains to nothing within minutes. During the frenzy, the worm that
							walks regenerates 2 points of health per round. A victim's equipment is retained for later
							study.</p>
						<p>A worm that walks can also emit a psychic burst that can target up to three creatures in
							short range as its action. On a failed Intellect defense roll, a victim suffers 4 points of
							Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and is unable to take actions on their subsequent turn. If
							the victim is attacked while so stunned, their defenses are hindered by two steps.</p>

					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> A worm that walks can communicate telepathically with

						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A worm that walks has been active in a small rural community for weeks,

						<p>A wraith can become fully insubstantial. After it does so, the creature can't change state
							again until its next turn. While insubstantial, it can't affect or be affected by anything
							(except for weapons and attacks that specifically affect undead or phased creatures), and it
							can pass through solid matter without hindrance, but even simple magical wards can keep it
							at bay. While partly insubstantial (its normal state), a wraith can affect and be affected
							by others normally.</p>
						<p>A group of five wraiths can act as a swarm, focusing on one target to make one attack roll as
							a single level 4 creature dealing 5 points of damage.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Most wraiths moan and scream in rage. The rare few that retain
							reason can speak in a sepulchral voice, and they may even negotiate. Any alliance with a
							wraith is usually short-lived, since the creature eventually forgets itself and descends
							fully into rage and the desire to spread destruction.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> The PCs are attacked while attending a burial, or they happen to pass

						(18)</span><a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#creature-wyvern" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Wyverns are aggressive lesser cousins of dragons. Their bodies are about the size of a heavy horse
					but their wingspan makes them seem much larger. Lacking a dragon's fiery breath or other magical
					abilities, wyverns rely on their strong flight and deadly stinger to catch and kill their prey,
					typically humanoids or large animals. Wyverns have four limbs&mdash; two legs used for clumsy
					walking and two arm-wings used for flight and balance.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Hungers for flesh</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Mountains, hills, and plains where large prey is plentiful</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Health:</strong> 35</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Damage Inflicted:</strong> 5 points</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Armor:</strong> 1</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Short; long when flying</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Perception as level 7; Speed defense as level 5 due to size
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Wyverns prefer to attack from the air, moving up to a short distance
							and making three attacks (bite, venomous stinger, claws) as their action. If a wyvern has to
							fight on the ground, it can attack only with its bite and stinger on its turn.</p>
						<p>The stinger injects poison, dealing an additional 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if
							the opponent fails a Might defense roll. Because the wyvern hunts primarily out of hunger,
							it usually focuses its attacks on one creature, weakening the prey so the wyvern can carry
							it away and eat in peace.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Wyverns lack the intelligence of true dragons. They are
							relatively smart animals (on par with large reptiles such as crocodiles) but can be
							distracted by easy prey. Allowing one to catch a pig, pony, or riding horse can give
							characters enough time to get safely away.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> Hungry wyverns are known to swoop in and carry off livestock and
							travelers near a particular road or field. A gang of crafty bandits has managed to train a
							couple of wyverns as mounts and use them as flying cavalry for their troops on the ground.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Loot:</strong> Wyverns do not collect treasure, but their nest might have a few
							cyphers from previous victims. If carefully extracted, an intact venom gland from a dead
							wyvern can be used to poison one weapon (if sold, it is the equivalent of an expensive
							item).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>GM intrusions:</strong> As part of its attack, the wyvern grabs hold of the character and
						flies a short distance away. The character can escape with a Might or Speed defense roll (which
						probably means they fall to the ground and land prone). The wyvern uses a wing or its tail to
						slam a character so they are thrown a short distance away and land prone.</p>

						class="float-end">6 (18)</span><a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#creature-xenoparasite"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>This alien creature exists only to eat and reproduce. In doing so, it also destroys every form of
					life it encounters. Xenoparasites are not technological but were likely engineered by a species with
					advanced biological super-science. Xenoparasites don't travel between star systems on their own;
					they were presumably spread across an area of space by their creators to serve as a broad-spectrum
					bioweapon. What has become of the original maker species is unknown, but given the fecundity and
					ferocity of the xenoparasite, it's likely they were consumed by their own creation.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Xenoparasites use ovipositors to lay thousands of microscopic eggs in victims.
					The implanted eggs, like tiny biological labs, detect the particular biology of the new host, adapt
					accordingly, and use it to fertilize themselves. Within a day or two, victims who haven't already
					been consumed by adult xenoparasites (which are human sized) give explosive birth to multiple
					vicious juveniles (which are the size of cats). These juvenile xenoparasites have an edge in dealing
					with the particular species of creature they hatched from.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Eat and reproduce</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A xenoparasite bites with its mandibles and stings one victim with
							its ovipositor as a single action. The bite inflicts 6 points of damage, and the ovipositor
							inflicts 3 points of damage and injects thousands of microscopic eggs if the victim fails a
							Might defense roll.</p>
						<p>Once every other round, an adult can fly at least a short distance to build terrifying
							velocity and then make a flying attack with its mandibles, dealing 12 points of damage.
							Defenses against this attack are hindered.</p>
						<p>An egg host requires the attention of someone skilled in medicine (and a successful
							difficulty 7 Intellect-based roll) to sterilize all the eggs in the victim's blood before
							they hatch twenty or more hours after being deposited, which kills the host and releases 1d6
							juvenile xenoparasites. Juveniles are level 2 creatures, but they attack the species of the
							host they were hatched from as if level 4. After just a few days of feeding, they grow to
							full adult size.</p>
						<p>Xenoparasites can survive at crushing ocean and gas giant pressures, as well as in the vacuum
							of space. They can encrust abandoned spacecraft and desolate moons for millennia in extended
							hibernation, only to become active again when vibrations alert them to potential new food
							sources.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> These creatures are built to consume, not negotiate.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> Xenoparasites are tough aliens. A colony of them would be a challenge
							even for PCs normally accustomed to stiff opposition. A single xenoparasite introduced into
							an inhabited area could turn the entire place into an infested hive within a week.</p>

						(9)</span><a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#creature-zombie" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Humans transformed into aggressive, hard-to-kill serial killers with no memory of their former
					existence are called zombies. Depending on a zombie's origin, the reason for its transformation
					varies. A zombie might arise from an undead curse, a psychic possession, an AI meatware overwrite, a
					viral infection, a drug overdose, or something else. Regardless of how the transformation happened,
					the result is much the same: a creature whose humanity has been burned out and replaced with
					unquenchable hunger.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Zombies aren't intelligent, but enough of them together sometimes exhibit
					emergent behavior, just as ants can coordinate activities across a colony. Thus, zombies alone or in
					small groups aren't an overwhelming threat for someone who has a baseball bat or can get away. But
					it's never wise to laugh off a zombie horde.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent-hang">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Hunger (for flesh, cerebrospinal fluid, certain human hormones, and
							so on)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Almost anywhere, in groups of five to seven, or in hordes of
							tens to hundreds</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Health:</strong> 12</p>
					</li>

						<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Immediate</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Speed defense as level 2</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Zombies never turn away from a conflict.</p>
						<p>They fight on, no matter the odds, usually attacking by biting, but sometimes by tearing with
							hands made into claws by the erosion of skin over their finger bones.</p>
						<p>When zombies attack in groups of five to seven individuals, they can make a single attack
							roll against one target as one level 5 creature, inflicting 5 points of damage.</p>
						<p>Zombies are hard to finish off. If an attack would reduce a zombie's health to 0, it does so
							only if the number rolled in the attack was an even number; otherwise, the zombie is reduced
							to 1 point of health instead. This might result in a dismembered, gruesomely damaged zombie
							that is still moving. Zombies can see in the dark at short range.</p>
						<p>"Fresh" zombies are vulnerable to electricity. The first time a zombie takes 5 or more points
							of damage from an electrical attack, it falls limp and unmoving. Assuming nothing interferes
							with the process, the zombie arises minutes or hours later without the vulnerability.</p>
						<p>Some zombies are infectious. Their bites spread a level 8 disease that moves a victim down
							one step on <a href="#the-damage-track">the damage track</a> each day a Might defense roll
							is failed. Victims killed by the disease later animate as zombies.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Zombies groan when they see something that looks tasty. They do
							not reason, cannot speak, and never stop pursuing something they've identified as a
							potential meal, unless something else edible comes closer.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> The characters are asked to clear out a space that once served as an
							old military depot. The appearance of zombies sealed in the area comes as an unpleasant
							surprise.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p><strong>GM intrusion:</strong> When the character fails to kill a zombie by rolling an odd number
						on an attack that otherwise would have been successful, in addition to the normal effect, the

						<p><strong>Health, Not Pools:</strong> Remember that NPCs don't have stat Pools. Instead, they

							subtracted from its health. Unless described otherwise, an NPC's health is always equal to
							its target number. Some NPCs might have special reactions to or defenses against attacks
							that would normally deal Speed damage or Intellect damage, but unless the NPC's description
							specifically explains this, assume that all damage is subtracted from the NPC's health.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Appropriate Weapons:</strong> NPCs use weapons appropriate to their situation, which

				<p>A bard uses the power of words and music to create magic that inspires and influences others. A

						<p>A bard knows several spells, such as adding +1 to <a href="#recovery-rolls">recovery

							indifferent) for a few minutes, deafening one opponent for hours, easing a physical task by
							two steps, turning invisible for a minute, or negating sound for a minute.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Bards are personable and easy to talk to, but they have a sharp
							wit and a sharper tongue when it comes to critics and tyrants. A bard would rather escape
							from a dangerous situation than fight to the death.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A bard ally often has useful information about the current situation,

				<p>A berserker is a fierce warrior who can fly into a rage, greatly increasing their strength and

						<p>A berserker can enter a state of rage as part of their action. When raging, they gain +1 to
							Armor (including against fire), their melee attacks inflict an additional 2 points of
							damage, and their attacks, Might defense, and actions relying on strength (such as climbing
							and jumping) are eased by two steps. However, their Speed defense is hindered. A raging
							berserker fights only with melee weapons and won't retreat from battle.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Berserkers are the elites of some warrior cultures and enjoy
							physical competitions such as wrestling, throwing heavy items, and feasting. They dislike
							weak and cowardly folk, and do not tolerate insults to their strength or honor.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> A group of warriors is led by a mighty berserker looking for a

				<p>A crime boss usually isn't physically powerful but wields power through lies, bribery, and control.

				<p>A druid is a servant of a nature deity or the entirety of nature itself. Some have specific interests

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Druids are cautious when dealing with city folk, and they act

					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Halflings enjoy the company of larger folks as long as they

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Occultists are deeply concerned with spiritual or demonic

					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Use:</strong> To find a needed answer, the spirit of a dead person must be

					Cyphers
				</h3>
				<p>Cyphers are one-use abilities that characters gain over the course of play. They have cool powers
					that can heal, make attacks, ease or hinder task rolls, or (in a more supernatural and extreme
					example) produce effects such as nullifying gravity or turning something invisible.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Most cyphers aren't physical objects&mdash;just something useful that happens
					right when you need it. They might be a burst of insight that allows a character to make a perfectly
					executed attack, a lucky guess when using a computer terminal, a coincidental distraction that gives
					you an advantage against an NPC, or a supernatural entity that makes things work out in your favor.
					In some games, cyphers come in the form of items, like magic potions or bits of alien technology.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Cyphers that don't have a physical form are called subtle cyphers.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Cyphers that have a physical form are called manifest cyphers.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Regardless of their form, cyphers are single-use effects and are always
					consumed when used. Unless a cypher's description says otherwise, it works only for the character
					who activates it. For example, a PC can't use an enduring shield cypher on a friend.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Cyphers are a game mechanic designed for frequent discovery and use. PCs can
					have only a small number of cyphers at any given time, and since they're always finding more,
					they're encouraged to use them at a steady pace.
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In theory, the cyphers gained by the PCs are determined randomly. However, the
					GM can allow PCs to acquire or find them intentionally as well. Cyphers are gained with such
					regularity that the PCs should feel that they can use them freely. There will always be more, and
					they'll have different benefits. This means that in gameplay, cyphers are less like gear or treasure
					and more like character abilities that the players don't choose. This leads to fun game moments
					where a player can say "Well, I've got an X that might help in this situation," and X is always
					different. X might be an intuitive understanding of the local computer network, a favor from the
					Faerie Court, an explosive device, a short-range teleporter, or a force field. It might be a
					powerful magnet or a prayer that will cure disease. It could be anything. Cyphers keep the game
					fresh and interesting. Over time, characters can learn how to safely carry more and more cyphers at
					the same time, so cyphers really do seem more like abilities and less like gear.
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>"Carry" in this sense refers to both subtle cyphers and manifest cyphers, though a PC may not
						actually carry anything that physically represents the cypher. A character thrown into prison
						without their equipment might still have subtle cyphers.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Cyphers don't have to be used to make room for new ones. For subtle cyphers, a character can just use
					an action to "lose" the cypher, freeing up space to "find" one later (once a subtle cypher is
					discarded this way, it is gone and can't be recovered). For manifest cyphers, it's perfectly
					acceptable for the PCs to stash one elsewhere for later use; of course, that doesn't mean it will
					still be there when they return.</p>

							href="#why-cyphers" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
					<p>Cyphers are (not surprisingly, based on the name) the heart of the Cypher System. This is because
						characters in this game have some abilities that rarely or never change and can always be
						counted on&mdash;pretty much like in all games&mdash;and they have some abilities that are
						ever-changing and inject a great deal of variability in play. They are the major reason why no
						Cypher System game session should ever be dull or feel just like the last session. This week
						your character can solve the problem by walking through walls, but last time it was because you
						could create an explosion that could level a city block.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">The Cypher System, then, is one where PC abilities are fluid, with the GM
						and the players both having a role in their choice, their assignment, and their use. Although
						many things separate the game system from others, this aspect makes it unique, because cyphers
						recognize the importance and value of two things:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>"Treasure," because character abilities make the game fun and exciting. In fact, in the
								early days of roleplaying, treasure (usually in the form of magic items found in
								dungeons) was really the only customization of characters that existed. One of the
								drives to go out and have adventures is so you can discover cool new things that help
								you when you go on even more adventures. This is true in many RPGs, but in the Cypher
								System, it's built right into the game's core.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Letting the GM have a hand in determining PC abilities makes the game move more smoothly.
								Some GMs prefer to roll cyphers randomly, but some do not. For example, giving the PCs a
								cypher that will allow them to teleport far away might be a secret adventure seed placed
								by a forward-thinking GM. Because the GM has an idea of where the story is going, they
								can use cyphers to help guide the path. Alternatively, if the GM is open to it, they can
								give out cyphers that enable the characters to take a more proactive role (such as
								teleporting anywhere they want). Perhaps most important, they can do these things
								without worrying about the long-term ramifications of the ability. A device that lets
								you teleport multiple times might really mess up the game over the long term. But once?
								That's just fun.</p>

				</div>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="cypher-limits">Cypher Limits<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#cypher-limits"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>All characters have a maximum number of cyphers they can have at any one time, determined by their
					type. If a character ever attempts to carry more, random cyphers instantly disappear until the PC
					has a number of cyphers equal to their maximum (depending on the genre of the campaign, subtle
					cyphers may be more or less likely to vanish this way). These vanished cyphers are not recoverable.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="subtle-cyphers">Subtle Cyphers<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#subtle-cyphers"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Subtle (nonphysical) cyphers are a way to introduce cyphers into a game without overt "powered
					stuff"&mdash;no potions, alien crystals, or anything of that nature. They're most useful, perhaps,
					in a modern or horror setting without obvious fantasy elements. Subtle cyphers are more like the
					inherent abilities PCs have, adding boosts to Edge, recovering points from Pools, coming up with
					ideas, and so on. In general, these are commonplace, non-supernatural effects&mdash;a subtle cypher
					wouldn't create a laser beam or allow a character to walk through a wall. They don't break the
					fragile bubble of believability in genres where flashy powers and abilities don't make a lot of
					sense.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Subtle cyphers are particularly nice in a genre where the PCs are supposed to
					be normal people. The cyphers can simply be an expression of innate capabilities in characters that
					aren't always dependable. And in many ways, that's probably more realistic than an ability you can
					count on with certainty, because in real life, some days you can jump over a fence, and some days
					you just can't.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Concepts for subtle cyphers include the following:</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Good fortune:</strong> Once in a while, things just go your way. You're in the right
							place at the right time.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Inspirations:</strong> Sometimes you get inspired to do something you've never done
							before and might not be able to do again. Call it adrenaline mixed with the right
							motivation, or just doing the right thing at the right place at the right time. Who can
							really define it? Life's funny that way.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Alien concepts:</strong> Complex and utterly inhuman memes enter our world and worm
							their way into and out of human consciousness. When this happens, it can cause mental
							distress and disorientation. It can also grant impossible abilities and advantages.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Blessings:</strong> In a fantasy world, there are nine gods. Each morning, all
							intelligent residents of the world pray to one of the gods, and some of the faithful gain a
							divine blessing. Some people believe that praying to different gods gives you different
							blessings.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Earworms:</strong> You know how some songs pop into your head and just won't leave?
							There's a power to those songs, and the right people know how to harness it. Make the songs
							disturbing or reminiscent of evil chants, and you've got a perfect cypher concept for a
							horror campaign.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Mysterious transmissions:</strong> What's that buzzing? That mechanical chittering?
							Those numbers repeating over and over? And why can only some people hear it? A few who are
							aware of the sounds have learned how to make use of them.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Supernatural powers:</strong> Mental or mystical energies constantly shift and
							change, ebb and flow. But you've figured out how to attune your mind to them. There are no
							physical actions or paraphernalia required&mdash;just an inner conduit to the numinous.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="discovering-subtle-cyphers">Discovering Subtle Cyphers<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#discovering-subtle-cyphers" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Since subtle cyphers aren't physical objects, GMs will need to figure out when to give PCs new ones
					to replace the ones they have used. The cyphers probably shouldn't be tied to actions entirely under
					the characters' control&mdash;in other words, they shouldn't come as a result of meditation or
					anything of that nature. Instead, the GM should choose significant points in the story when new
					cyphers might simply come unbidden to the PCs. In the broader view, this is no different than
					manifest cyphers placed as treasure in a creature's lair, a secret cache, or somewhere else for the
					characters to find. Either way, the GM is picking good spots to "refill" potentially used
					cypher-based abilities.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Subtle cyphers are often found in groups of one to six (the GM can roll 1d6 to
					determine the number). The GM might randomly assign the cyphers to each PC who has space for more,
					or present a selection of cyphers to the group and allow the players to choose which ones they want
					for their characters. Characters should immediately know what their subtle cyphers do. If a PC
					activates a healing subtle cypher when they think it's something to help pick a lock, that's a waste
					of a useful character ability.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">PCs might be able to obtain subtle cyphers from NPCs or in unusual
					circumstances as gifts, boons, or blessings, even asking for a particular kind of subtle cypher,
					such as healing, protection, or skill. For example, PCs who make a donation at a temple of a healing
					goddess could ask to receive a blessing (subtle cypher) that allows them to speak a healing prayer
					that restores points to one of their Pools. An NPC wizard who owes the PCs a favor might cast a
					spell on them that deflects one weapon if they say a magic word. An alien pylon might grant
					knowledge of a strange mental code that lets a person see in the dark for a few hours.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A PC can also acquire a new subtle cypher by spending 1 XP on one of the
					following player intrusions:</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>General cypher:</strong> You ask the GM for a general subtle cypher, such as
							"healing," "movement," "defense," or perhaps something as specific as "flight." The GM gives
							you a cypher that meets that description and randomly determines its level. If you don't
							have space for this cypher, you immediately lose one of your current cyphers (your choice)
							and the new cypher takes its place.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Specific cypher:</strong> You ask the GM for a specific subtle cypher (such as a <a
								href="#cypher-curative">curative</a> or <a href="#cypher-stim">stim</a>) of a specific
							level. Make an Intellect roll with a difficulty equal to the cypher's level plus 1. If you
							have had this cypher before, the task is eased. If you fail the roll, you do not gain a
							cypher. If you succeed, the GM gives you that subtle cypher at that level. If you don't have
							space for this new cypher, you immediately lose one of your current cyphers (your choice)
							and the new cypher takes its place. Whether or not you succeed at the roll, the 1 XP is
							spent.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="manifest-cyphers">Manifest Cyphers<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#manifest-cyphers"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Because manifest cyphers are physical objects, and people are familiar with the idea of finding
					"treasure" as part of playing an RPG, these kinds of cyphers are easy to get into the hands of the
					PCs. They are often found in groups of one to six (the GM can roll 1d6 to determine the number),
					usually because the characters are searching for them. They might be among the possessions of a
					fallen foe, hidden in a secret room, or scattered amid the wreckage of a crashed starship. The GM
					can prepare a list ahead of time of what successful searchers find. Sometimes this list is random,
					and sometimes there is logic behind it. For example, a warlock's laboratory might contain four
					different magic potions that the PCs can find.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If the characters search for cyphers, the GM sets the difficulty of the task.
					It is usually 3 or 4, and scavenging can take fifteen minutes to an hour.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Scavenging is not the only way to obtain manifest cyphers. They can also be
					given as gifts, traded with merchants, or sometimes purchased in a shop.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Unlike subtle cyphers, characters don't automatically know what manifest
					cyphers do. Once the PCs find a manifest cypher, identifying it is a separate task, based on
					Intellect and modified by knowledge of the topic at hand. In a fantasy setting, that knowledge would
					probably be magic, but in a science fiction setting, it might be technology. The GM sets the
					difficulty of the task, but it is usually 1 or 2. Thus, even the smallest amount of knowledge means
					that cypher identification is automatic. The process takes one to ten minutes. If the PCs can't
					identify a cypher, they can bring it to an expert for identification and perhaps trade, if desired.

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#manifest-cyphers-duplicating-subtle-cyphers"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Lots of overlap exists between what subtle cyphers and manifest cyphers can do. Nearly anything that
					can be explained as a subtle cypher can just as easily be a magic item, scientific device, or other
					manifest object. A bit of luck that helps you sneak (a subtle cypher) and a potion that helps you
					sneak (a manifest cypher) do the exact same thing for a character. One advantage of manifest cyphers
					is that characters can easily trade them to each other or sell them to NPCs. On the other hand,
					manifest cyphers can be dropped or stolen, and subtle cyphers can't.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It's fine if the GM decides to include both kinds of cyphers in the same game.
					A horror game could begin with the PCs as normal people with subtle cyphers, but as time goes on,
					they find one-use spells in occult tomes, weird potions, and bone dust that has strange powers.</p>

				<h4 id="using-cyphers">Using Cyphers<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#using-cyphers"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>The action to use a cypher is Intellect based unless described otherwise or logic suggests otherwise.
					For example, throwing an explosive might be Speed based because the device is physical and not
					really technical, but using a ray emitter is Intellect based.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Because cyphers are single-use items, cyphers used to make attacks can never
					be used with the <a href="#ability-spray">Spray</a> or <a href="#ability-arc-spray">Arc Spray</a>
					abilities that some characters might have. They are never treated as rapid-fire weapons.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Identified manifest cyphers can be used automatically. Once a manifest cypher
					is activated, if it has an ongoing effect, that effect applies only to the character who activated
					the cypher. A PC can't activate a cypher and then hand it to another character to reap the benefits.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A character can attempt to use a manifest cypher that has not been identified;
					this is usually an Intellect task using the cypher's level. Failure might mean that the PC can't
					figure out how to use the cypher or that they use it incorrectly (GM's discretion). Of course, even
					if the PC activates the unidentified cypher, they have no idea what its effect will be.</p>

				<p>All cyphers have a level and an effect. The level sometimes determines an aspect of the cypher's
					power (how much damage it inflicts, for example) but otherwise it only determines the general
					efficacy, the way level works with any object. The Level entry for a cypher is usually a die roll,
					sometimes with a modifier, such as 1d6 or 1d6 + 4. The GM can roll to determine the cypher's level,
					or can allow the player to roll when they receive the cypher.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="normal-and-fantastic-effects">Normal and Fantastic Effects<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#normal-and-fantastic-effects" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Cypher effects fall into two categories: normal and fantastic. Normal effects are things that could
					reasonably happen or be explained in the normal physical world we're familiar with. Fantastic
					effects are things that can't. A normal person could hit a target 240 feet (73 m) away with a
					football, quickly get over a cold, run across a tightrope, or multiply two two-digit numbers in
					their head. These tasks are difficult, but possible. A normal person can't throw an armored car,
					regrow a severed arm, create a robot out of thin air, or control gravity with their mind. These
					tasks are impossible according to the world as we know it. Cypher effects are either normal
					(possible) or fantastic (impossible according to the world as we know it).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Normal cypher effects should be available to PCs regardless of the genre of
					your game. It's perfectly reasonable for a modern, fantasy, horror, science fiction, or superhero PC
					to have a cypher that gives them a one-use bonus on an attack or skill task, lets them take a quick
					breather to recover a few points in a Pool, or helps them focus their will to avoid distractions or
					fatigue.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Fantastic cypher effects should be limited to games where magic, technology,
					or other factors stretch the definition of "impossible." A cypher that turns a corpse into a zombie
					is out of place in a non-fantastic modern game, but is perfectly reasonable for a fantasy, science
					fiction, or superhero game, or even a horror game where zombies exist, as long as the GM decides
					there is an appropriate story explanation for it. The zombie cypher might be a necromantic spell in
					a fantasy or superhero game, a code that activates a swarm of nanobots in a science fiction game, or
					a virus in a horror game. The rules categorize some cypher effects as fantastic to help the GM
					decide whether to exclude cyphers that don't fit the game they're running. For example, it is
					appropriate for a GM running a zombie horror survival game set in 1990s Georgia to allow the
					zombie-creating cypher but not a teleportation cypher, because creating a zombie is a fantastic
					effect that fits the setting and teleportation isn't.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Fantastic cyphers can be subtle or manifest.</p>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">

						Duplicating Fantastic Effects<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
							href="#optional-rule-normal-cyphers-duplicating-fantastic-effects" title="Permalink"
							aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
					<p>If the GM and players are willing to stretch their imaginations a bit, it's possible to include
						some fantastic cypher effects in a game where only normal cypher effects should exist, even if
						the PCs are only using subtle cyphers. The player using the cypher just needs to come up with a
						practical, realistic explanation for how the fantastic result occurred (perhaps with a much
						shorter or reduced effect than what's described in the cypher text).</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, a PC with a <a href="#cypher-phase-changer">phase changer</a>
						who is trapped in a prison cell could say that instead of physically phasing through the wall,
						using the cypher means they find a long-forgotten secret door connected to a narrow hallway
						leading to safety. A PC with a <a href="#cypher-detonation-spawn">fire detonation</a> could say
						they notice a can of paint thinner in the room, kick it over, and throw a table lamp into the
						spill, creating a spark and a momentary burst of harmful flames. A PC with a <a
							href="#cypher-monoblade">monoblade</a> could say they spot structural flaws in an opponent's
						armor, allowing them to attack for the rest of that combat in such a way that the foe's Armor
						doesn't count.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">These interpretations of fantastic cyphers in a non-fantastic setting
						require player ingenuity and GM willingness to embrace creative solutions (similar to players
						using <a href="#player-intrusions">player intrusions</a> to make a change in the game world).
						The GM always has the right to veto the explanation for the fantastic effect, allowing the
						player to choose a different action instead of using the fantastic cypher.</p>

				<p>None of the manifest cyphers in this chapter have a stated physical form. The entries don't tell you
					if something is a potion, a pill, or a device you hold in your hands because that sort of detail
					varies greatly from genre to genre. Are they magic? Are they tech? Are they symbiotic creatures with
					programmed DNA? That's up to the GM. It's flavor, not mechanics. It's as important or unimportant as
					the style of an NPC's hair or the color of the car the bad guys are driving. In other words, it's
					the kind of thing that is important in a roleplaying game, but at the same time doesn't actually
					change anything (and RPGs have a lot of things like that, if you think about it).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A manifest cypher's physical form can be anything at all, but there are some
					obvious choices based on genre. The GM can design a setting that uses just one type&mdash;for
					example, a magical world where all cyphers are potions made by faeries. Or they can use many types,
					perhaps mixing them from different genres. Some suggestions include the following.</p>

				<p>Magic items are a staple of fantasy stories and games. In the Cypher System, these magic items are,
					of course, cyphers. The Cypher System assumes that subtle cyphers are the default, but in a fantasy

					with magical powers, which the heroes find as treasure, gifts, or rewards for their adventures and

				<h4 id="setting-difficulty-ratings">Setting Difficulty Ratings<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#setting-difficulty-ratings" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>The GM's most important overall tasks are setting the stage and guiding the story created by the
					group (not the one created by the GM ahead of time). But setting difficulty is the most important
					mechanical task the GM has in the game. Although there are suggestions throughout this chapter for
					various difficulty ratings for certain actions, there is no master list of the difficulty for every
					action a PC can take. Instead, the Cypher System is designed with the "teach a person to fish" style
					of good game mastering in mind. (If you don't know what that means, it comes from the old adage
					"Give a person a fish and they'll eat for a day. Teach a person to fish and they'll eat for a
					lifetime." The idea is not to give GMs a ton of rules to memorize or reference, but to teach them
					how to make their own logical judgment calls.) Of course, most of the time, it's not a matter of
					exact precision. If you say the difficulty is 3 and it "should" have been 4, the world's not over.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For the most part, it really is as simple as rating something on a scale of 1
					to 10, 1 being incredibly easy and 10 being basically impossible. The guidelines in the Task
					Difficulty table should help put you in the right frame of mind for assigning difficulty to a task.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, we make the distinction between something that most people can do
					and something that trained people can do. In this case, "normal" means someone with absolutely no
					training, talent, or experience&mdash;imagine your ne'er-do-well, slightly overweight uncle trying a
					task he's never tried before. "Trained" means the person has some level of instruction or experience
					but is not necessarily a professional.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">With that in mind, think about the act of balance. With enough focus, most
					people can walk across a narrow bridge (like a fallen tree trunk). That suggests it is difficulty 2.
					However, walking across a narrow plank that's only 3 inches (8 cm) wide? That's probably more like
					difficulty 3. Now consider walking across a tightrope. That's probably difficulty 5&mdash;a normal
					person can manage that only with a great deal of luck. Someone with some training can give it a go,
					but it's still hard. Of course, a professional acrobat can do it easily. Consider, however, that the
					professional acrobat is specialized in the task, making it difficulty 3 for them. They probably are
					using Effort as well during their performance.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Let's try another task. This time, consider how hard it might be to remember
					the name of the previous leader of the village where the character lives. The difficulty might be 0
					or 1, depending on how long ago they were the leader and how well known they were. Let's say it was
					thirty years ago and they were only mildly memorable, so it's difficulty 1. Most people remember
					them, and with a little bit of effort, anyone can come up with their name. Now let's consider the
					name of the leader's daughter. That's much harder. Assuming the daughter wasn't famous in her own
					right, it's probably difficulty 4. Even people who know a little about local history (that is to
					say, people who are trained in the subject) might not be able to remember it. But what about the
					name of the pet dog owned by the daughter's spouse? That's probably impossible. Who's going to
					remember the name of an obscure person's pet from thirty years ago? Basically no one. However, it's
					not forbidden knowledge or a well-guarded secret, so it sounds like difficulty 7. Difficulty 7 is
					the rating that means "No one can do this, yet some people still do." It's not the stuff of legend,
					but it's something you would assume people can't do. When you think there's no way you can get
					tickets for a sold-out concert, but somehow your friend manages to score a couple anyway, that's
					difficulty 7. (See the next section for more on difficulties 7, 8, 9, and 10.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you're talking about a task, ideally the difficulty shouldn't be based on
					the character performing the task. Things don't get inherently easier or harder depending on who is
					doing them. However, the truth is, the character does play into it as a judgment call. If the task
					is breaking down a wooden door, an 8-foot-tall (2 m) automaton made of metal with nuclear-driven
					motors should be better at breaking it down than an average human would be, but the task rating
					should be the same for both. Let's say that the automaton's nature effectively gives it two levels
					of training in such tasks. Thus, if the door has a difficulty rating of 4, but the automaton is
					specialized and reduces the difficulty to 2, it has a target number of 6. The human has no such
					specialization, so the difficulty remains 4, and the person has a target number of 12. However, when
					you set the difficulty of breaking down the door, don't try to take all those differences into
					account. The GM should consider only the human because the Task Difficulty table is based on the
					ideal of a "normal" person, a "trained" person, and so on. It's humanocentric.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Most characters probably are willing to use one or two levels of Effort on a
					task, and they might have an appropriate skill or asset to decrease the difficulty by a step. That
					means that a difficulty 4 task will often be treated as difficulty 2 or even 1, and those are easy
					rolls to make. Don't hesitate, then, to pull out higher-level difficulties. The PCs can rise to the
					challenge, especially if they are experienced.</p>
				<h5 id="the-impossible-difficulties">The Impossible Difficulties<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#the-impossible-difficulties" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Difficulties 7, 8, 9, and 10 are all technically impossible. Their target numbers are 21, 24, 27, and
					30, and you can't roll those numbers on a d20 no matter how many times you try. Consider, however,
					all the ways that a character can reduce difficulty. If someone spends a little Effort or has some
					skill or help, it brings difficulty 7 (target number 21) into the range of
					possibility&mdash;difficulty 6 (target number 18). Now consider that they have specialization, use a
					lot of Effort, and have help. That might bring the difficulty down to 1 or even 0 (reducing it by
					two steps from training and specialization, three or four steps from Effort, and one step from the
					asset of assistance). That practically impossible task just became routine. A fourth-tier character
					can and will do this&mdash;not every time, due to the cost, but perhaps once per game session. You
					have to be ready for that. A well-prepared, motivated sixth-tier character can do that even with a
					difficulty 10 task. Again, they won't do it often (they'd have to apply six levels of Effort, and
					even with an Edge of 6 that would cost 7 points from their Pool, and that's assuming they're
					specialized and have two levels of assets), but it can happen if they're really prepared for the
					task (being specialized and maxed out in asset opportunities reduces the difficulty by four more
					steps). That's why sixth-tier characters are at the top of their field, so to speak.</p>

				<h5 id="false-precision">False Precision<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#false-precision"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>One way to look at difficulty is that each step of difficulty is worth 3 on the die. That is to say,
					hinder the task by one step, and the target number rises by 3. Ease the task by one step, and the
					target number is lowered by 3. Those kinds of changes are big, meaty chunks. Difficulty, as a game
					mechanic, is not terribly precise. It's measured in large portions. You never have a target number
					of 13 or 14, for example&mdash;it's always 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and so on. (Technically, this is not
					true. If a character adds 1 to a d20 roll for some reason, it changes a target number of 15 to 14.
					But this is not worth much discussion.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Imprecision is good in this case. It would be false precision to say that one
					lock has a target number of 14 and another has a target number of 15. What false precision means in
					this context is that it would be a delusion to think we can be that exact. Can you really say that
					one lock is 5% easier to pick than another? And more important, even if you could, is the difference
					worth noting? It's better to interact with the world in larger, more meaningful chunks than to try
					to parse things so carefully. If we tried to rate everything on a scale of 1 to 30 (using target
					numbers and not difficulty), we'd start to get lost in the proverbial weeds coming up with a
					meaningful distinction between something rated as an 8 and something rated as a 9 on that scale.</p>
				<h5 id="routine-action">Routine Actions<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#routine-action"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Don't hesitate to make actions routine. Don't call for die rolls when they're not really needed.
					Sometimes GMs fall into the trap illustrated by this dialogue:</p>
				<div class="mt-4 ml-3 mb-4">
					<p><strong>GM:</strong> What do you do?</p>
					<p><strong>Player:</strong> I _________.</p>
					<p><strong>GM:</strong> Okay, give me a roll.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">That's not a good instinct&mdash;at least, not for the Cypher System. Players
					should roll when it's interesting or exciting. Otherwise, they should just do what they do. If the
					PCs tie a rope around something and use it to climb down into a pit, you could ask for tying rolls,
					climbing rolls, and so on, but why? Just to see if they roll terribly? So the rope can come undone
					at the wrong time, or a character's hand can slip? Most of the time, that makes players feel
					inadequate and isn't a lot of fun. A rope coming undone in the middle of an exciting chase scene or
					a battle can be a great complication (and that's what GM intrusions are for). A rope coming undone
					in the middle of a simple "getting from point A to point B" scene only slows down gameplay. The real
					fun&mdash;the real story&mdash;is down in the pit. So get the PCs down there.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">There are a million exceptions to this guideline, of course. If creatures are
					throwing poisoned darts at the PCs while they climb, that might make things more interesting and
					require a roll. If the pit is filled with acid and the PCs must climb halfway down, pull a lever,
					and come back up, that's a situation where you should set difficulty and perhaps have a roll. If a
					PC is near death, carrying a fragile item of great importance, or something similar, climbing down
					the rope is tense, and a roll might add to the excitement. The important difference is that these
					kinds of complications have real consequences.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">On the flip side, don't be afraid to use <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM
						intrusion</a> on routine actions if it makes things more interesting. Walking up to the king in
					his audience chamber in the middle of a ceremony only to trip on a rug? That could have huge
					ramifications for the character and the story.</p>
				<h5 id="other-ways-to-judge-difficulty">Other Ways to Judge Difficulty<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#other-ways-to-judge-difficulty" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Rating things on a scale of 1 to 10 is something that most people are very familiar with. You can
					also look at it as rating an object or creature on a similar scale, if that's easier. In other
					words, if you don't know how hard it would be to climb a particular cliff face, think of it as a
					creature the PCs have to fight. What level would the creature be? You could look in <a
						href="#chapter-22-creatures">Chapter 22: Creatures</a> and say "I think this wall should be
					about as difficult to deal with as a demon. A demon is level 5, so the task of climbing the wall
					will be difficulty 5." That's a weird way to do it, perhaps, but it's fairly straightforward. And if
					you're the kind of GM who thinks in terms of "How tough will this fight be?" then maybe rating tasks
					as creatures or NPCs to fight isn't so strange after all. It's just another way to relate to them.
					The important thing is that they're on the same scale. Similarly, if the PCs have to tackle a
					knowledge task&mdash;say, trying to determine if they know where a caravan is headed based on its
					tracks&mdash;you could rate the task in terms of an object. If you're used to rating doors or other
					objects that the PCs have broken through recently, the knowledge task is just a different kind of
					barrier to bust through.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Everything in the Cypher System&mdash;characters, creatures, objects, tasks,
					and so on&mdash;has a level. It might be called a tier or a difficulty instead of a level, but
					ultimately it's a numerical rating system used to compare things. Although you have to be careful
					about drawing too many correlations&mdash;a first-tier character isn't easily compared to a
					difficulty 1 wall or a level 1 animal&mdash;the principle is the same. Everything can be rated and
					roughly compared to everything else in the world. (It works best to take PCs out of this equation.
					For example, you shouldn't try to compare a PC's tier to a wall's level. Character tiers are
					mentioned here only for completeness.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Last, if your mind leans toward statistics, you can look at difficulty as a
					percentage chance. Every number on the d20 is a 5% increment. For example, you have a 5% chance of
					rolling a 1. You have a 10% chance of rolling a 1 or a 2. Thus, if you need to roll a 12 or higher,
					you have a 45% chance of success. (A d20 has nine numbers that are 12 or higher: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
					17, 18, 19, and 20. And 9 &times; 5 equals 45.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For some people, it's easier to think in terms of a percentage chance. A GM
					might think "She has about a 30% chance to know that fact about geography." Each number on a d20 is
					a 5% increment, and it takes six increments to equal 30%, so there are six numbers that mean the PC
					succeeds: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Thus, since the player has to roll 15 or higher, that means
					the target number is 15. (And that means the task is level 5, but if you've already determined the
					target number, you likely don't care about the level.)</p>

					<h5 class="og-csrd-header-small" id="advantages-to-this-system">Advantages to This System<a
							class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#advantages-to-this-system" title="Permalink"
							aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
					<ol>
						<li>The GM makes measured adjustments in large, uniform steps. That makes things faster than if
							players had to do arithmetic using a range of all numbers from 1 to 20.</li>
						<li>You calculate a target number only once no matter how many times the PCs attempt the action.
							If you establish that the target number is 12, it's 12 every time a PC tries that action.
							(On the other hand, if you had to add numbers to your die roll, you'd have to do it for
							every attempt.) Consider this fact in light of combat. Once a player knows that they need to
							roll a 12 or higher to hit a foe, combat moves very quickly.</li>
						<li>If a PC can reduce the difficulty of an action to 0, no roll is needed. This means that an
							Olympic gymnast doesn't roll a die to walk across a balance beam, but the average person
							does. The task is initially rated the same for both, but the difficulty is reduced for the
							gymnast. There's no chance of failure.</li>
						<li>This is how everything in the game works, whether it's climbing a wall, sweet-talking a
							guard, or fighting a bioengineered horror.</li>

						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>GM intrusion is the main mechanic that the GM uses to inject drama and additional excitement into the
					game. It's also a handy tool for resolving issues that affect the PCs but do not involve them. GM
					intrusion is a way to facilitate what goes on in the world outside the characters. Can the minotaur
					track the PCs' movements through the maze? Will the fraying rope hold?</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Since the players roll all the dice, GM intrusion is used to determine if and
					when something happens. For example, if the PCs are fighting a noble's guards, and you (the GM) know
					that there are more guards nearby, you don't need to roll dice to determine if the other guards hear
					the scuffle and intervene (unless you want to). You just decide when it would be best for the
					story&mdash;which is probably when it would be worst for the characters. In a way, GM intrusion
					replaces the GM's die rolling.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The mechanic is also one of the main ways that GMs award experience points to
					the PCs. This means that you use experience points as a narrative tool. Whenever it seems
					appropriate, you can introduce complications into the game that affect a specific player, but when
					you do so, you give that player 1 XP. The player can refuse the intrusion, but doing so costs them 1
					XP. So by refusing an intrusion, the player does not get the experience point that the GM is
					offering, and they lose one that they already have. (This kind of refusal is likely to happen very
					rarely in your game, if ever. And, obviously, a player can't refuse an intrusion if they have no XP
					to spend.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Here's how a GM intrusion might work in play. Say the PCs find a hidden
					console with some buttons. They learn the right order in which to press the buttons, and a section
					of the floor disappears. As the GM, you don't ask the players specifically where their characters
					are standing. Instead, you give a player 1 XP and say "Unfortunately, you're standing directly over
					this new hole in the floor." If the player wanted, they could refuse the XP, spend one of their own,
					and say "I leap aside to safety." Most likely, though, they'll make the defense roll that you call
					for and let it play out.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">There are two ways for the GM to handle this kind of intrusion. You could say
					"You're standing in the wrong place, so make a roll." (It's a Speed defense roll, of course.)
					Alternatively, you could say "You're standing in the wrong place. The floor opens under your feet,
					and you fall down into the darkness." In the first example, the PC has a chance to save themselves.
					In the second example, they don't. Both are viable options. The distinction is based on any number
					of factors, including the situation, the characters involved, and the needs of the story. This might
					seem arbitrary or even capricious, but you're the master of what the intrusion can and can't do. RPG
					mechanics need consistency so players can make intelligent decisions based on how they understand
					the world to work. But they'll never base their decisions on GM intrusions. They don't know when
					intrusions will happen or what form they will take. GM intrusions are the unpredictable and strange
					twists of fate that affect a person's life every day.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">When player modifications (such as skill, Effort, and so on) determine that
					success is automatic, the GM can use GM intrusion to negate the automatic success. The player must
					roll for the action at its original difficulty level or target number 20, whichever is lower.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Remember, any time you give a player 1 XP for a GM intrusion, you're actually giving them
						2&mdash; one to keep and one to give to another player.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="using-gm-intrusion-as-a-narrative-tool">Using GM Intrusion as a Narrative Tool<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#using-gm-intrusion-as-a-narrative-tool" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>A GM can use this narrative tool to steer things. That doesn't mean railroad the players or direct
					the action of the game with a heavy hand. GM intrusion doesn't enable you to say "You're all
					captured, so here's your 1 XP." Instead, the GM can direct things more subtly&mdash;gently, almost
					imperceptibly influencing events rather than forcing them. GM intrusion represents things going
					wrong. The bad guys planning well. Fortune not favoring the characters.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Consider this scenario: the GM plants an interesting adventure seed in a small
					village, but the PCs don't stay there long enough to find it. So just outside the village, the PCs
					run afoul of a vicious viper that bites one of them. The GM uses intrusion to say that the poison
					from the snake will make the character debilitated unless they get a large dose of a specific
					antitoxin, which the group doesn't have. Of course, they aren't required to go back to the village
					where the GM's interesting adventure can start, but it's likely that they will, looking for the
					antitoxin.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some players might find intrusion heavy-handed, but the XP softens the blow.
					And remember, they can refuse these narrative nudges. Intrusion is not meant to be a railroading
					tool&mdash;just a bit of a rudder. Not an inescapable track, but a nudge here and there.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">What's more, the GM doesn't need to have a deliberate goal in mind. The
					complication you introduce could simply make things more interesting. You might not know where it
					will take the story, just that it will make the story better.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This is wonderfully empowering to the GM&mdash;not in a "Ha ha, now I'll
					trounce the PCs" way, but in an "I can control the narrative a little bit, steering it more toward
					the story I want to create rather than relying on the dice" sort of way. Consider that old classic
					plot development in which the PCs get captured and must escape from the bad guys. In heroic fiction,
					this is such a staple that it would almost seem strange if it didn't happen. But in many roleplaying
					games, it's a nearly impossible turn of events&mdash;the PCs usually have too many ways to get out
					of the bad guy's clutches before they're captured. The dice have to be wildly against them. It
					virtually never happens. With GM intrusion, it could happen (again, in the context of the larger
					encounter, not as a single intrusion that results in the entire group of PCs being captured with
					little explanation or chance to react).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">For example, let's say the PCs are surrounded by orcs. One character is badly
					injured&mdash;debilitated&mdash;and the rest are hurt. Some of the orcs produce a large weighted
					net. Rather than asking for a lot of rolls and figuring the mechanics for escape, you use intrusion
					and say that the net goes over the PCs who are still on their feet. The rest of the orcs point
					spears menacingly. This is a pretty strong cue to the players that surrender is a good (and possibly
					the only) option. Some players won't take the hint, however, so another use of intrusion might allow
					the orcs to hit one of the trapped PCs on the head and render them unconscious while their friends
					struggle in the net. If the players still don't surrender, it's probably best to play out the rest
					of the encounter without more GM intrusions&mdash;using more would be heavy-handed by anyone's
					measure&mdash;although it's perfectly reasonable to rule that a character rendered debilitated is
					knocked unconscious, since the orcs are trying to take the PCs alive.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Remember that GM intrusions can occur at any time, not just during combat. Disrupting or changing
						a tense interaction with NPCs can have big repercussions.</p>

				<h5 id="using-gm-intrusion-as-a-resolution-mechanic">Using GM Intrusion as a Resolution Mechanic<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#using-gm-intrusion-as-a-resolution-mechanic"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>This mechanic offers a way for the GM to determine how things happen in the game without leaving it
					all to random chance. Bad guys trying to smash down the door to the room where the PCs are holed up?
					You could roll a bunch of dice, compare the NPCs' stats to the door's stats, and so on, or you could
					wait until the most interesting time, have the bad guys break in, and award an experience point to
					the PC who tried their best to bar the door. The latter way is the Cypher System way. Intrusion is a
					task resolution tool for the GM. In other words, you don't base things on stats but on narrative
					choice. (Frankly, a lot of great GMs over the years&mdash;even in the very early days of the
					hobby&mdash;have run their games this way. Sometimes they rolled dice or pretended to roll dice, but
					they were really manipulating things.) This method frees the GM from worrying about mechanics and
					looking up stats and allows them to focus on the story.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">This isn't cheating&mdash;it's the rules of the game. This rule simply
					replaces traditional dice rolling with good game mastering, logic, and intelligent storytelling.
					When a PC is climbing a burning rope, and everyone knows that it will break at some point, the game
					has a mechanism to ensure that it breaks at just the right time.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Variant:</strong> If you want more randomness in your game, or if you
					want your game to seem like more of a simulation, assign a flat percentage chance for whatever
					you're trying to resolve. For example, each round, the star troopers have a 20% chance to blast
					through the door&mdash;or, if you want the risk to escalate, a cumulative 20% chance to blast
					through the door. By not using GM intrusion, this method robs the PCs of a few XP, but when they see
					you rolling dice, it might help with their immersion. Alternatively, you can pretend to roll dice
					but really use GM intrusion, though this method seriously robs the characters of XP.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">There's a better way. Announce your intrusion, but say that there's only a
					chance it will happen (state the percentage chance), and then roll the dice in plain view of
					everyone. If the intrusion occurs, award the XP as normal. This is likely the best of both worlds.
					However, it takes the narrative power out of your hands and gives it to the dice. Perhaps this
					method is best used only occasionally. If nothing else, it injects some variety and certainly some
					drama.</p>

				<p>Too much of a good thing will make the game seem utterly unpredictable&mdash;even capricious. The
					ideal is to use about four GM intrusions per game session, depending on the length of the session,
					or about one intrusion per hour of game play. This is in addition to any intrusions that are
					triggered by players rolling a 1.</p>
				<h5 id="intrusion-through-player-rolls">Intrusion Through Player Rolls<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#intrusion-through-player-rolls" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>When a PC rolls a 1, handle the GM intrusion the same way that you'd handle an intrusion you
					initiated. The intrusion could mean the PC fumbles or botches whatever they were trying to do, but
					it could mean something else. Consider these alternatives:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In combat, the PC's foe is not as hurt as they thought. Give the foe 5 extra points of health.
					</li>
					<li>In combat, the PC drops their guard, and the foe gets a free attack.</li>
					<li>In combat, reinforcements for the PC's foes show up.</li>
					<li>In combat (or any stressful situation), an ally decides to flee.</li>
					<li>In combat (or any stressful situation), an ally doesn't like the PCs as much as they thought.
						The ally steals from them or betrays them.</li>
					<li>Out of combat, the PC's pack falls open, or the sole of their shoe tears open.</li>
					<li>Out of combat, it begins to rain heavily.</li>
					<li>Out of combat, a surprise foe appears, and the scene turns into a combat.</li>
					<li>In an interaction, the GM introduces a surprising motive for the NPC. For example, the PCs are
						trying to bribe an official for information, and the official reveals that what they really want
						isn't money but for someone to rescue their kidnapped son.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>This might not be true of your players, but many players rarely, if ever, spend XP to refuse an
						intrusion from the GM, though they regularly use XP to avoid an intrusion that comes from a bad
						roll. And there's nothing wrong with that. Some GMs might want to forbid using an XP to reroll a
						1, but there's really no point&mdash;if you've got an idea for a good intrusion, you don't need
						to wait until a player rolls a 1 to use it.</p>
				</div>
				<h5 id="gm-intrusion-that-affects-the-group">GM Intrusion That Affects the Group<a
						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#gm-intrusion-that-affects-the-group" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>The core of the idea behind GM intrusion is that the player being adversely affected gains an
					experience point. But what if the intrusion affects the whole group equally? What if the GM uses it
					to have an unstable device overload and explode, harming all the characters? In this case, if no PC
					is involved more than the others (for example, no single PC was frantically attempting to repair the
					device), you should give 1 XP to each character but not give any of them an extra XP to hand out to
					someone else.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">However, this kind of group intrusion should be an exception, not the rule. GM
					intrusions are much more effective if they are more personal.</p>

				<p><a href="#player-intrusions">Player intrusions</a> give the players a small bit of narrative control
					over the world. However, the world still remains in the GM's purview. You can always overrule a
					player intrusion, or suggest a way to massage it so that it fits better into the setting. Still,
					because it is indeed narrative control, a player intrusion should always involve a small aspect of
					the world beyond the character. "I punch my foe really hard" is an expression of Effort or perhaps
					character ability. "My foe slips and falls backward off the ledge" is a player intrusion.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Player intrusions should never be as big as GM intrusions. They should not end
					an encounter, only (perhaps) provide the PC with the means to more easily end an encounter. They
					should not have a wide-reaching or even necessarily a long-term effect on the setting. A way to
					consider this might be that player intrusions can affect a single object (a floorboard snaps),
					feature (there's a hidden shallow spot in the stream to ford), or NPC (the vendor is an old friend).
					But not more than that. A player intrusion can't affect a whole village or even a whole tavern in
					that village. A rock can come loose, but a player intrusion can't create a landslide.</p>

				<h4 id="running-the-game-cyphers">Cyphers<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#running-the-game-cyphers" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>You should think of cyphers as character abilities, whether they're subtle cyphers or manifest
					cyphers. This means that it is incumbent upon you to make sure that players always have plenty of
					cyphers to use. In the course of their travels, the PCs should find that cyphers are extremely
					common. And since the PCs are limited in the number of cyphers they can carry, they will use them
					liberally.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Manifest cyphers can be found by scavenging through old ruins. They can be
					found in the corpses of magical or technological foes. They can be found among the possessions of
					intelligent fallen opponents or the lairs of unintelligent creatures, either amid the bones of
					former meals or as shiny decorations in a nest. They can be found in villages, in the back of a
					merchant's cart that sells and scavenged parts. They are offered as rewards by people who are
					grateful for the PCs' help.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Some adventures will offer more cyphers than others. Still, as a rule of
					thumb, in any given adventure, a character should use at least as many cyphers as they can carry.
					This means they should find that number of cyphers in that same amount of time (give or take). Thus,
					you can simply add up the number of cyphers the PCs can carry, and on average, they should find at
					least that many cyphers in a given adventure.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">If your players are typical, they will use combat-related cyphers liberally
					but hold onto their utility cyphers. A ray emitter or defensive shield will be used, but a suspensor
					belt or phasing module will linger longer on their character sheets.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">As with everything else in the game, it's intentionally very easy for the GM
					to create new cyphers. Just think of the effect and how to express it as a game advantage. Two kinds
					of cyphers exist when it comes to effect: those that allow the user to do something better, and
					those that allow the user to do something they couldn't do otherwise.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The first group includes everything that reduces the difficulty of a task
					(including defense tasks). The second group includes things that grant new abilities, such as
					flight, a new means of attack, the ability to see into the past, or any number of other powers.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A few more important notes about devising new cyphers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cyphers should be single-use items. The PCs use them up and find new ones.</li>
					<li>Cyphers should be potent. A minor ability isn't worth the trouble. If an attack cypher isn't as
						good as a regular weapon, why bother with it?</li>
					<li>Cyphers shouldn't have drawbacks.</li>
					<li>Cyphers should be temporary. Typically, a power is used once. Abilities or advantages that have
						a duration last from ten minutes to twenty-four hours (at most).</li>
					<li>Manifest cyphers can take any form. Just make them appropriate to the genre.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>Cyphers teach GMs to design different kinds of scenarios&mdash;ones in which the whole adventure
						isn't wrecked if a player has something that can solve a single problem (defeat a foe, read a
						mind, bypass a barrier, or whatever). There should always be more to the adventure than one
						linchpin encounter, obstacle, foe, or secret.</p>
					<p class="og-csrd-indent">It's all right if players think of cyphers (especially manifest cyphers)
						as equipment or treasure. You should choose points in the course of the story that are
						appropriate for awarding subtle cyphers, especially if the PCs aren't at their full capacity.

						href="#running-the-game-artifacts" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>In terms of the narrative, artifacts are a lot like cyphers, except that most are not one-use items.
					Mechanically, they serve a very different purpose. It's assumed that characters are exploring with
					some cyphers at their disposal. Artifacts, however, are added abilities that make characters
					broader, deeper, and often more powerful. They aren't assumed&mdash;they're extra.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The powers granted by artifacts are more like the abilities gained from a
					character's type or focus in that they change the way the PC is played overall. The difference
					between an artifact and a type or focus ability is that almost all artifacts are temporary. They
					last longer than cyphers do, but because they have a depletion roll, any use could be their last.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Like cyphers, then, artifacts are a way for the GM to play a role in the
					development of the characters. Although armor, weapons, and the like are fine, special
					capabilities&mdash;such as long-range communication or travel&mdash;can really change the way the
					PCs interact with the world and how they deal with challenges. Some of these abilities enable the
					actions you want the PCs to take. For example, if you want them to have an underwater adventure,
					provide them with artifacts (or cyphers) that allow them to breathe underwater.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Also like cyphers, artifacts are simple for the GM to create. The only
					difference with artifacts is that you give them a depletion roll, using any numbers on 1d6, 1d10,
					1d20, or 1d100. If you want the artifact to be used only a few times, give it a depletion roll of 1
					in 1d6, 1 or 2 in 1d10, or even 1 or 2 in 1d6. If you want the PCs to use it over and over, a
					depletion roll of 1 in 1d100 more or less means that they can use it freely without worrying too
					much.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>You may wish to forbid the use of XP to reroll artifact depletion rolls. That's pretty
						reasonable.</p>

						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Sometimes, the rules speak directly to character creativity. For example, players can make up their
					own skills. It's possible to have a skill called "tightrope walking" that grants a character a
					better chance to walk across a tightrope, and another skill called "balance" that gives a character
					a better chance to walk across a tightrope and perform other balance actions as well. This might
					seem unequal at first, but the point is to let players create precisely the characters they want.
					Should you let a character create a skill called "doing things" that makes them better at
					everything? Of course not. The GM is the final arbiter not only of logic but also of the spirit of
					the rules, and having one or two single skills that cover every contingency is clearly not in the
					spirit.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It's important that players play the character they want. This concept is
					supported not only with the open-ended skill system but also with the ability to get an experience
					point advance to tailor a character further. Likewise, the GM should be open to allowing a player to
					make small modifications to refine their character. In many cases, particularly ones that don't
					involve stat Pools, Armor, damage inflicted, or the costs of Effort or special abilities, the answer
					from the GM should probably be "Sure, why not?" If a PC ends up being really good at a particular
					skill&mdash;better than they "should" be&mdash;what's the harm? If Dave can swim incredibly well,
					how does that hurt the game in terms of the play experience or the story that develops? It doesn't.
					If Helen can pick practically any mundane lock she finds, why is that a bad thing? In fact, it's
					probably good for the game&mdash;there's likely something interesting on the other sides of those
					doors.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In a way, this is no different than adjudicating a not-so-straightforward
					solution to a challenge. Sometimes you have to say "No, that's not possible." But sometimes, if it
					makes sense, open yourself up to the possibility.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="npcs-and-death">NPCs and Death<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#npcs-and-death"
						title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>As explained in <a href="#chapter-11-rules-of-the-game">Chapter 11: Rules of the Game</a>, NPCs have
					a health score rather than three stat Pools. When an NPC reaches 0 health, they are down. Whether
					that means dead, unconscious, or incapacitated depends on the circumstances as dictated by you and
					the players. Much of this can be based on logic. If the NPC is cut in half with a giant axe, they're
					probably dead. If they're mentally assaulted with a telepathic attack, they might be insane instead.
					If they're hit over the head with a club, well, that's your call.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">It depends on the intentions of those who are fighting the NPC, too. PCs who
					want to knock out a foe rather than kill them can simply state that as their intention and describe
					their actions differently&mdash;using the flat of the blade, so to speak.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="running-the-game-creatures">Creatures<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#running-the-game-creatures" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Whenever possible, creatures should be handled like other NPCs. They don't follow the same rules as
					the player characters. If anything, they should have greater latitude in doing things that don't fit
					the normal mold. A many-armed beast should be able to attack multiple foes. A charging rhino-like
					animal ought to be able to move a considerable distance and attack as part of a single action.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Consider creature size very carefully. For those that are quick and hard to
					hit, hinder attacks against them. Large, strong creatures should be easier to hit, so ease attacks
					against them. However, you should freely give the stagger ability to anything twice as large as a
					human. This means that if the creature strikes a foe, the target must make an immediate Might
					defense roll or lose its next turn.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">A creature's level is a general indicator of its toughness, combining aspects
					of power, defense, intelligence, speed, and more into one rating. In theory, a small creature with
					amazing powers or extremely deadly venom could be high level, and a huge beast that isn't very
					bright and isn't much of a fighter could be low level. But these examples go against type.
					Generally, smaller creatures have less health and are less terrifying in combat than larger ones.
				</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The Cypher System has no system for building creatures. There is no rule that
					says a creature with a certain ability should be a given level, and there is no rule dictating how
					many abilities a creature of a given level should have. But keep the spirit of the system in mind.
					Lower-level creatures are less dangerous. A level 1 creature could be poisonous, but its venom
					should inflict a few points of damage at most. The venom of a level 6 creature, however, might knock
					a PC down a step on <a href="#the-damage-track">the damage track</a> or put them into a coma if they
					fail a Might defense roll. A low-level creature might be able to fly, phase through objects, or
					teleport because these abilities make it more interesting but not necessarily more dangerous. The
					value of such abilities depends on the creature that uses them. In other words, a phasing rodent is
					not overly dangerous, but a phasing battle juggernaut is terrifying. Basic elements such as health,
					damage, and offensive or defensive powers (such as poison, paralysis, disintegration, immunity to
					attacks, and so on) need to be tied directly to level&mdash;higher-level creatures get better
					abilities and more of them.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="balancing-encounters">Balancing Encounters<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#balancing-encounters" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>In the Cypher System, there is no concept of a "balanced encounter." There is no system for matching
					creatures of a particular level or tasks of a particular difficulty to characters of a particular
					tier. To some people, that might seem like a bad thing. But matching character builds to exacting
					challenges is not part of this game. It's about story. So whatever you want to happen next in the
					story is a fine encounter as long as it's fun. You're not denying the characters XP if you make
					things too easy or too difficult, because that's not how XP are earned. If things are too difficult
					for the PCs, they'll have to flee, come up with a new strategy, or try something else entirely. The
					only thing you have to do to maintain "balance" is set difficulty within that encounter accurately
					and consistently.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">In a game like the Cypher System, if everyone's having fun, the game is
					balanced. Two things will unbalance the game in this context.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>One or more PCs are far more interesting than the others. Note that it says "more interesting,"
						not "more powerful." If my character can do all kinds of cool things but can't destroy robots as
						efficiently as yours does, I still might have a whole lot of fun.</li>
					<li>The challenges the PCs face are routinely too easy or too difficult.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The first issue should be handled by the character creation rules. If there's
					a problem, it might be that poor choices were made or a player isn't taking full advantage of their
					options. If someone really doesn't enjoy playing their character, allow them to alter the PC
					or&mdash;perhaps better&mdash;create a new one.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The second issue is trickier. As previously stated, there is no formula that
					states that N number of level X NPCs are a good match for tier Y characters. However, when the game
					has four or five beginning characters, the following guidelines are generally true.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Level 1 opponents will be nothing but a nuisance, even in sizable numbers (twelve to sixteen).
					</li>
					<li>Level 2 opponents will not be a challenge unless in numbers of twelve or more.</li>
					<li>Level 3 opponents will be an interesting challenge in numbers of four to eight.</li>
					<li>Level 4 opponents will be an interesting challenge in numbers of two or three.</li>
					<li>A single level 5 opponent might be an interesting challenge.</li>
					<li>A single level 6 opponent will be a serious challenge.</li>
					<li>A single level 7 or 8 opponent will likely win in a fight.</li>
					<li>A single level 9 or 10 opponent will win in a fight without breaking a sweat.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">But it depends on the situation at hand. If the PCs are already worn down from
					prior encounters, or if they have the right cyphers, any of the expectations listed above can
					change. That's why there is no system for balancing encounters. Just keep in mind that beginning
					characters are pretty hardy and probably have some interesting resources, so you aren't likely to
					wipe out the group by accident. Character death is unlikely unless the PCs have already been through
					a number of other encounters and are worn down.</p>

					Cypher Shorts
				</h3>
				<p>Cypher Shorts are what we call quick and easy adventures for use with the Cypher System. The idea
					here is an adventure with very quick character creation and minimal GM prep, designed for a one-shot
					game that can be finished in a single session of three to four hours. If a typical campaign is an
					ongoing television series, think of a Cypher Short as a movie.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Cypher Shorts is a supplement for the Cypher System.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">There are some key concepts to a Cypher Short that you'll want to keep in mind
					if you're playing, running, or creating one for yourself. They include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Very simple characters that are immediately involved in the situation. No long expository
						lead-ins, no "meet in a tavern" scenes.</li>
					<li>Characters have clear objectives, and there's no thought to <a
							href="#character-advancement">character advancement</a>. This is a one-shot game, and we
						aren't concerned about what came before or what comes after.</li>
					<li>There is less of a plot than there is a situation. Plot implies a linear direction: "This
						happens, then this, then this." Cypher Shorts are meant to be framed more like: "You're involved
						in this situation, so what do you do?"</li>
					<li>Just as players should use improvisation to react to and deal with situations they didn't know
						were coming, the GM should be ready to do the same.</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="cypher-shorts-character-creation">Character Creation<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#cypher-shorts-character-creation" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Cypher Shorts use an abbreviated character creation system, even simpler than the standard Cypher
					System. This is to help players move quickly, without spending a lot of time deciding between this
					focus and that one.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">The following character creation guidelines are very broad, designed to work
					with any genre or situation. In a specific Cypher Short, it's likely that only the type choices will
					be detailed, using the information here as a starting point. Descriptors and foci are general enough
					that they'll work with almost any scenario. Sometimes, though, a Cypher Short might require
					adjustments to suit the situation.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Just like in the standard system, characters end up with a sentence to
					describe themselves: "I am a [blank] [blank] who [blanks]." All players start with a score of 9 in
					their stat Pools, with 6 points to divide among them as they wish. They have an Edge of 1 in a stat
					of their choosing. <a href="#recovery-rolls">Recovery rolls</a> are 1d6 + 1, and characters have an
					Effort of 1. (Otherwise, don't worry about tier.)</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">All characters start with 1 XP.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4 id="cypher-shorts-descriptors">Descriptors<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#cypher-shorts-descriptors" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>A descriptor quickly and easily distinguishes the character from the others. Ideally, no two players
					have the same descriptor.</p>

					outline of a plot. Think of these as the possible scenes of your movie. More than likely, the group
					will have time for only five or six encounters in one session, so feel free to pick and choose the
					ones that best fit the way the game seems to be going.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each encounter is presented with a trigger, meaning that it is triggered by
					some action of the characters.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Each encounter comes with the relevant game stats: the challenges for common
					tasks the PCs might attempt, the levels of NPCs involved, and other information not related to game
					stats, such as the answers to the questions the PCs might ask, the personality of any relevant NPC,
					and so on.</p>

						class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#cypher-shorts-gm-intrusions" title="Permalink"
						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Each Cypher Short comes with a brief list of <a href="#gm-intrusion">GM intrusion</a> suggestions
					that are specific to that scenario.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Remember that GM intrusions are the only way for players to earn <a
						href="#chapter-12-experience-points">Experience Points (XP)</a> in the scenario, so they're
					really important. At the same time, they will probably spend any XP they get. So there might be more
					calls for rerolls using XP in a Cypher Short adventure than you're used to in a standard Cypher
					System game.</p>

						aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p>Ideally, as with a movie, the end of a Cypher Short session comes to a nice story conclusion (though
					not every ending needs to be a happy one). Hopefully, the main situation has been resolved one way
					or another, and the implications of what probably happens next for the characters and the setting
					are self-evident. But with a Cypher Short, we don't worry too much about what happens next. It's a
					one-shot scenario.</p>

				<p>The characters should be relatively mundane people. No supernatural powers. Cypher Short character
					suggestions include:</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">
					<li>
						<p><strong>Office Worker:</strong> This is probably someone with the <a
								href="#cypher-shorts-types-sneaking">Sneaking</a> type. The player should figure out the
							character's name, a very short personality brief, what company they work for, and what their
							job is: data entry, customer service, accounts manager, and so on.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Middle Manager:</strong> This is probably someone with the <a
								href="#cypher-shorts-types-searching">Searching And Discovering</a> type. The player
							should figure out the character's name, a very short personality brief, and what company
							they work for.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> The <a href="#cypher-shorts-types-talking">Talking</a> type
							would work well for this character. The player should figure out the character's name, a
							very short personality brief, and what company they work for.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Custodial Worker:</strong> This could be a <a
								href="#cypher-shorts-types-physical">Performing Physical Actions</a> character, or
							possibly a <a href="#cypher-shorts-types-searching">Searching And Discovering</a> character.
							The player should figure out the character's name and a very short personality brief. They
							have keys to most of the doors of the building and know the layout well. They might also
							have something like a mop and wheeled bucket, or a cart with various cleaning supplies, if
							the player wishes.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Security Guard:</strong> This is probably someone with the <a
								href="#cypher-shorts-types-physical">Performing Physical Actions</a> type. The player
							should figure out the character's name and a very short personality brief. They have a
							weapon (a nightstick, a taser, or perhaps a handgun), and keys to most of the doors in the
							building. They know the layout well.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">No one has any special equipment other than the typical: a cell phone, car
					keys, a half-drunk coffee, and maybe a briefcase with papers and pens or a tablet computer.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">

				<h4 id="trapped-in-flames-the-setup">The Setup<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#trapped-in-flames-the-setup" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>The characters all work in a tall skyscraper that houses many different businesses in a large city.
					They don't necessarily work together or even know each other. But they're all in a large lobby on
					the twenty-fifth floor, in front of a bank of four elevators, waiting for one to arrive. (A
					custodial worker probably is cleaning nearby rather than waiting for the elevator.) Suddenly, they
					hear an explosion, and the floor shudders and shakes. The fire alarms start ringing, and the power
					goes out, followed quickly by emergency lighting switching on, giving the area dim light.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">Obviously, the goal for the characters here is to get to safety. A
					safety-conscious person (like a security guard) would know that the safest thing to do is stay put,
					at least until the location of the fire is known (going down into smoke and flames is how many
					people die in high-rise fires).</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent">What the PCs don't know (yet) is that a terrorist has planted a number of
					bombs in the building. One of them went off prematurely on the tenth floor. There are more bombs,
					designed to bring the entire structure down. And because the bomb exploded early, the bomber is
					still in the building.</p>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">
					<h5 class="og-csrd-header-small" id="trapped-in-flames-other-facts">Other Facts:<a
							class="og-csrd-header-anchor" href="#trapped-in-flames-other-facts" title="Permalink"
							aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
					<ul>
						<li>The floor the PCs are on has only a few other people on it currently.</li>
						<li>It will take about ten minutes for first responders to arrive. They will take positions
							around the base of the building, and, after determining that the fire is on floor 10, will
							evacuate floors below that and set up on floor 8. This will likely take ten to fifteen
							minutes. During this time, authorities will attempt to contact anyone on floors above 10 and
							tell them to stay put, so office phones and some cell phones will start ringing. It's very
							likely that more bombs will go off at this time, with rescue workers recalled for safety.
						</li>
						<li>Emergency services will be jammed with calls.</li>
						<li>The elevator cabs all descend to the ground floor and no longer function.</li>
						<li>Whenever the fire spreads to a new floor, the sprinklers will go off. This is enough to keep
							the fire from spreading too much or too quickly, but the incendiary bombs make it impossible
							for the sprinklers alone to put the fire out.</li>

					<p>Most of the NPCs coming down from above continue down the stairs to lower floors, with or without
						the PCs.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Checking cell phones:</strong> PCs can reach their loved ones at
					first, although this provides no real information. If they're able to get through to emergency
					services, they are told that emergency responders are on their way and to stay put. It's too soon to
					get much information from the internet, although a few minutes after it happens, there are reports
					of an explosion in the building on either floor 10 or floor 12. Building Wi-Fi is down. Data and
					phone usage becomes spotty about five minutes after the explosion and can't be relied upon.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Going Up a Stairwell to the Roof:</strong> There is a pregnant person
					on the stairway who can't be moved. Helping them deliver the baby safely is a difficulty 3
					Intellect-based task and will take about twenty minutes.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Reaching the Roof:</strong> There are a few other people on the roof,
					but no rescue workers. Eventually, a small helicopter flies overhead, and if the bomber is not
					visibly present, it will circle but not land. This is the terrorist's accomplice in a small
					two-person helicopter. The pilot is level 3 and has body armor (+2 Armor), a handgun, and a knife.
					If the bomber is present, the helicopter will land very briefly to try to rescue him.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Going Down a Stairwell:</strong> The PCs hear cries for help as they
					pass by a floor. If they investigate, they find an office close to the stairs where someone is
					trapped underneath a very heavy shelving unit. It is a difficulty 4 task to rescue them. They are
					level 2 and their leg is quite injured.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Going Further Down the Stairwell:</strong> Three people stand in the
					stairwell and tell the PCs to go back up. They say it's not safe to try to evacuate, and the PCs
					should go back up to higher floors. They won't take no for an answer. They will argue with the
					characters, and trying to win that argument is a difficulty 7 task. They will use force to back up
					their point&mdash;they won't try to harm the PCs, but they will try to physically block the
					characters. Getting past them is a difficulty 5 task. Individually, they are each level 3.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Going Even Further Down the Stairwell:</strong> Smoke! The stairwell
					is quickly becoming a chimney, even before the PCs get close to the tenth floor. Visibility is
					almost nil (treat as complete darkness) and characters must succeed at Might defense rolls each
					round or suffer 2 points of damage and lose their next action. The difficulty level starts at 2 but
					increases by 1 every other round.</p>
				<div class="alert bg-dark ps-4">
					<h5 class="og-csrd-header-small" id="trapped-in-flames-fire">Fire!<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
							href="#trapped-in-flames-fire" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
					<p>If the PCs descend to the eleventh floor, they find fire rages there (and it extends down to the
						ninth). The explosive(s) are incendiary and designed to start hot fires that can eventually
						bring the building down. Characters on thesefloors must make Speed defense rolls each round or
						suffer 6 points of damage. Even characters who succeed at their rolls suffer 3 points of damage
						from the heat, flames, smoke, and lack of oxygen.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Firefighters to the Rescue:</strong> Eventually, the firefighters make
					a clear and relatively safe path out of the building through one of the stairwells, and they work to
					get everyone out. This is a great time for one last GM Intrusion, or for the PCs who have seen the
					bomber to spot him trying to sneak out posing as a victim&mdash;perhaps as they exit the building.

						href="#trapped-in-flames-gm-intrusions" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Explosion:</strong> First and foremost, the GM's best tools in this
					scenario are the subsequent explosions from more bombs. The bomber has planted many bombs throughout
					the building, and they can go off any time, any place. This isn't just one GM intrusion, but
					several, and they come in two varieties:</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Close explosion:</strong> One or more PCs are threatened by falling
					debris (difficulty 5). Speed defense rolls are required; otherwise, victims suffer 6 points of
					damage and are trapped and need to work to get free.</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Very close explosion:</strong> All PCs must succeed at Speed defense
					rolls or suffer damage as mentioned above. Even those who succeed suffer 3 points of damage. Plus,
					there are smoke and fire dangers in the immediate area, as described in the "Going Even Further Down
					the Stairwell" encounter. Wherever the PCs are currently, that place is not safe. More debris will
					fall, floors will collapse, and fire and smoke will spread. If the PCs are on the roof, this might
					mean there's a risk of being blown off!</p>
				<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>The Terrorist:</strong> The PCs spot the bomber setting another bomb.
					He is a level 5 NPC with body armor (+2 Armor), a handgun, and a knife. He'll fight, but mostly he
					just wants to get away. A GM Intrusion allowing him to get away from aggressive PCs means they can
					encounter him again somewhere else. Eventually, he tries to get to the roof and signal his ally in
					the helicopter to pick him up. Failing that, he ditches his gear and tries to get out with the rest
					of the victims when the firefighters arrive.</p>

				<h4 id="trapped-in-flames-the-conslusion">The Conclusion<a class="og-csrd-header-anchor"
						href="#trapped-in-flames-the-conslusion" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
				<p>Ultimately, the PCs very likely just want to get to safety. When they do, the scenario is pretty much
					over. They're wrapped in blankets by firefighters and loaded into ambulances. If they stopped or
					apprehended the bomber, the authorities will want to talk to them, and they will be hailed as heroes
					in the press.</p>
				<div class="og-csrd-sidebar bg-dark pt-3 pb-1 ps-3 pe-3 mt-3 mb-3">
					<p>It's not hard to imagine how you could modify this scenario slightly for the <a
							href="#chapter-15-science-fiction">science fiction</a> genre using a space station rather
						than a skyscraper. You could also have one of the PCs be an undercover FBI agent on the lookout
						for the terrorist, or even an undercover foreign agent working for the terrorist.</p>
